  abstract      = {A key question in clarifying human-environment interactions is how dynamic complexity develops across integrative scales from molecular to population and global levels. Apart from its public health importance, measles is an excellent test bed for such an analysis. Simple mechanistic models have successfully illuminated measles dynamics at the city and country levels, revealing seasonal forcing of transmission as a major driver of long-term epidemic behavior. Seasonal forcing ties closely to patterns of school aggregation at the individual and community levels, but there are few explicit estimates of school transmission due to the relative lack of epidemic data at this scale. Here, we use data from a 1904 measles outbreak in schools in Woolwich, London, coupled with a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to analyze measles incidence data. Our results indicate that transmission within schools and age classes is higher than previous population-level serological data would suggest. This analysis sheds quantitative light on the role of school-aged children in measles cross-scale dynamics, as we illustrate with references to the contemporary vaccination landscape.},

Further, the observed B.{}longimanus effect is most consistent with an NCE via reduced birth rates. The SSM approach also provided estimates for key biological parameters (e.g., demographic rates) and the contribution of dynamic stochasticity and measurement error. Our study therefore provides evidence derived directly from survey data that the invasive zooplankter B.{}longimanus is affecting zooplankton demographics and offer parameter estimates needed to inform predictive models that explore the effect of B.{}longimanus under different scenarios, such as climate change.},

  abstract      = {Although two strains of influenza A have been circulating globally for decades, these strains mutate quickly to try to escape host immunity. Many models exist to predict influenza seasons, but Du et al. have now incorporated evolutionary information to try to forecast upcoming H3N2 seasons in advance. After developing the model, they used it to predict that H3N2 in the pending 2016/2017 season will be at a higher incidence than has been seen recently and will involve substantial antigenic change in the hemagglutinin. Being able to predict this type of information could affect influenza countermeasures worldwide.Interpandemic or seasonal influenza A, currently subtypes H3N2 and H1N1, exacts an enormous annual burden both in terms of human health and economic impact. Incidence prediction ahead of season remains a challenge largely because of the virus' antigenic evolution. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates evolutionary change into a mechanistic epidemiological model. The proposed models are simple enough that their parameters can be estimated from retrospective surveillance data. These models link amino acid sequences of hemagglutinin epitopes with a transmission model for seasonal H3N2 influenza, also informed by H1N1 levels. With a monthly time series of H3N2 incidence in the United States for more than 10 years, we demonstrate the feasibility of skillful prediction for total cases ahead of season, with a tendency to underpredict monthly peak epidemic size, and an accurate real-time forecast for the 2016/2017 influenza season.},

  abstract  = {As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.},

  abstract  = {As polio eradication inches closer, the absence of poliovirus circulation in most of the world and imperfect vaccination coverage are resulting in immunity gaps and polio outbreaks affecting adults. Furthermore, imperfect, waning intestinal immunity among older children and adults permits reinfection and poliovirus shedding, prompting calls to extend the age range of vaccination campaigns even in the absence of cases in these age groups. The success of such a strategy depends on the contribution to poliovirus transmission by older ages, which has not previously been estimated. We fit a mathematical model of poliovirus transmission to time series data from two large outbreaks that affected adults (Tajikistan 2010, Republic of Congo 2010) using maximum-likelihood estimation based on iterated particle-filtering methods. In Tajikistan, the contribution of unvaccinated older children and adults to transmission was minimal despite a significant number of cases in these age groups [reproduction number, R = 0.46 (95\% confidence interval, 0.42-0.52) for >5-y-olds compared to 2.18 (2.06-2.45) for 0- to 5-y-olds]. In contrast, in the Republic of Congo, the contribution of older children and adults was significant [R = 1.85 (1.83-4.00)], perhaps reflecting sanitary and socioeconomic variables favoring efficient virus transmission. In neither setting was there evidence for a significant role of imperfect intestinal immunity in the transmission of poliovirus. Bringing the immunization response to the Tajikistan outbreak forward by 2 wk would have prevented an additional 130 cases (21\%), highlighting the importance of early outbreak detection and response.},

  abstract  = {Assessing the influence of climate on the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria worldwide and how it might impact local malaria dynamics is complex and extrapolation to other settings or future times is controversial. This is especially true in the light of the particularities of the short- and long-term immune responses to infection. In sites of epidemic malaria transmission, it is widely accepted that climate plays an important role in driving malaria outbreaks. However, little is known about the role of climate in endemic settings where clinical immunity develops early in life. To disentangle these differences among high- and low-transmission settings we applied a dynamical model to two unique adjacent cohorts of mesoendemic seasonal and holoendemic perennial malaria transmission in Senegal followed for two decades, recording daily P. falciparum cases. As both cohorts are subject to similar meteorological conditions, we were able to analyze the relevance of different immunological mechanisms compared with climatic forcing in malaria transmission. Transmission was first modeled by using similarly unique datasets of entomological inoculation rate. A stochastic nonlinear human-mosquito model that includes rainfall and temperature covariates, drug treatment periods, and population variability is capable of simulating the complete dynamics of reported malaria cases for both villages. We found that under moderate transmission intensity climate is crucial; however, under high endemicity the development of clinical immunity buffers any effect of climate. Our models open the possibility of forecasting malaria from climate in endemic regions but only after accounting for the interaction between climate and immunity.},

Despite the widespread application of models to emerging infectious diseases, we know little about the comparative performance of standard computational-statistical frameworks in these contexts. Here we build a simple stochastic, discrete-time, discrete-state epidemic model with both process and observation error and use it to characterize the effectiveness of different flavours of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We explore the limitations of different platforms and quantify parameter estimation accuracy, forecasting accuracy, and computational efficiency across combinations of modelling decisions (e.g. discrete vs. continuous latent states, levels of stochasticity) and computational platforms (JAGS, NIMBLE, Stan). Results: Simulations showed that models incorporating at least one source of population-level variation (i.e., dispersion in either the transmission process or the observation process) provide reasonably good forecasts and parameter estimates, while models that incorporate only individual-level variation can lead to inaccurate (or overconfident) results. Models using continuous-approximations to the transmission process showed improved computational efficiency without loss of accuracy. Conclusion: Simple models of disease transmission and observation can be fitted reliably to simple simulations, as long as population-level variation is taken into account. Continuous approximations can improve computational efficiency using more advanced MCMC techniques.},

  abstract  = {Bats are important reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases, yet the mechanisms that allow highly virulent pathogens to persist within bat populations remain obscure. In Latin America, vampire-bat-transmitted rabies virus represents a key example of how such uncertainty can impede efforts to prevent cross-species transmission. Despite decades of agricultural and human health losses, control efforts have had limited success. To establish persistence mechanisms of vampire-bat-transmitted rabies virus in Latin America, we use data from a spatially replicated, longitudinal field study of vampire bats in Peru to parameterize a series of mechanistic transmission models. We find that single-colony persistence cannot occur. Instead, dispersal of bats between colonies, combined with a high frequency of immunizing nonlethal infections, is necessary to maintain rabies virus at levels consistent with field observations. Simulations show that the strong spatial component to transmission dynamics could explain the failure of bat culls to eliminate rabies and suggests that geographic coordination of control efforts might reduce transmission to humans and domestic animals. These findings offer spatial dynamics as a mechanism for rabies persistence in bats that might be important for the understanding and control of other bat-borne pathogens.},

  abstract  = {Case notifications of pertussis have shown an increase in a number of countries with high rates of routine pediatric immunization. This has led to significant public health concerns over a possible pertussis re-emergence. A leading proposed explanation for the observed increase in incidence is the loss of immunity to pertussis, which is known to occur after both natural infection and vaccination. Little is known, however, about the typical duration of immunity and its epidemiological implications. Here, we analyze a simple mathematical model, exploring specifically the inter-epidemic period and fade-out frequency. These predictions are then contrasted with detailed incidence data for England and Wales. We find model output to be most sensitive to assumptions concerning naturally acquired immunity, which allows us to estimate the average duration of immunity. Our results support a period of natural immunity that is, on average, long-lasting (at least 30 years) but inherently variable.},

This is in part because inference for a stochastic transmission model can be difficult since the likelihood is often intractable due to partial observability. In this work, we address the question of adequate inclusion of variability by demonstrating a systematic approach for model selection and parameter inference for dynamic epidemic models. For this, we perform inference for six partially observed Markov process models, which assume the same underlying transmission dynamics, but differ with respect to the amount of variability they allow for. The inference framework for the stochastic transmission models is provided by iterated filtering methods, which are readily implemented in the R package pomp by King and others (2016, Statistical inference for partially observed Markov processes via the R package pomp. Journal of Statistical Software69, 1-43). We illustrate our approach on German rotavirus surveillance data from 2001 to 2008, discuss practical difficulties of the methods used and calculate a model based estimate for the basic reproduction number R_0 using these data.},

However, inference for these types of models can be difficult because the disease spread is typically only partially observed e.g. in form of reported incidences in given time periods. This chapter discusses how to perform likelihood-based inference for partially observed Markov epidemic models when it is relatively easy to generate samples from the Markov transmission model while the likelihood function is intractable. The first part of the chapter reviews the theoretical background of inference for partially observed Markov processes (POMP) via iterated filtering. In the second part of the chapter the performance of the method and associated practical difficulties are illustrated on two examples. In the first example a simulated data set consisting of the number of newly reported cases aggregated by week is fitted to a POMP where the underlying disease transmission model is assumed to be a simple Markovian SIR model. The second example illustrates possible model extensions by analyzing German rotavirus surveillance data from 2001 to 2008. Both examples are implemented using the R-package pomp (King et al., 2016) and the code is made available online.},

Pons-Salort and Grassly used Japanese surveillance data to model the interplay between the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals, accounting for declining birth and death rates, incomplete surveillance, and seasonality of infection (see the Perspective by Nikolay and Cauchemez). Enteroviruses have highly predictable yet highly nonlinear dynamics. The model also reveals signatures of increased pathogenicity and of antigenic change and transmissibility.Science, this issue p. 800; see also p. 755Human enteroviruses are a major cause of neurological and other diseases. More than 100 serotypes are known that exhibit unexplained complex patterns of incidence, from regular cycles to more irregular patterns, and new emergences. Using 15 years of surveillance data from Japan (2000-2014) and a stochastic transmission model with accurate demography, we show that acquired serotype-specific immunity can explain the diverse patterns of 18 of the 20 most common serotypes (including Coxsackieviruses, Echoviruses, and Enterovirus-A71). The remaining two serotypes required a change in viral characteristics, including an increase in pathogenicity for Coxsackievirus-A6, which is consistent with its recent global rise in incidence. On the basis of our findings, we are able to predict outbreaks 2 years ahead of time (2015-2016). These results have implications for the impact of vaccines under development.},

To understand transmission into human populations, filovirus dynamics within reservoir host populations must be understood. Studies have directly linked filoviruses to bats, but the mechanisms allowing viral persistence within bat populations are poorly understood. Theory suggests seasonal birthing may decrease the probability of pathogen persistence within populations, but data suggest MARV may persist within colonies of seasonally breeding Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus. I synthesize available filovirus and bat data in a stochastic compartmental model to explore fundamental questions relating to filovirus ecology: can filoviruses persist within isolated bat colonies; do critical community sizes exist; and how do host-pathogen relationships affect spillover transmission potential? Synchronous annual breeding and shorter incubation periods did not allow filovirus persistence, whereas bi-annual breeding and longer incubation periods, such as reported for Egyptian fruit bats and EBOV in experimental studies, allowed persistence in colony sizes often found in nature. Serological data support the findings, with bats from species with two annual birth pulses more likely to be seropositive (odds ratio (OR) 4.4, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-8.7) than those with one, suggesting that biannual birthing is necessary for filovirus persistence.},

Despite this, limited work has been done in comparing best-in-class techniques across the broad spectrum of time series forecasting methodologies. Forecasting frameworks were developed that utilised three methods designed to work with nonlinear dynamics: Iterated Filtering (IF) 2, Hamiltonian MCMC (HMC), and S-mapping. These were compared in several forecasting scenarios including a seasonal epidemic and a spatiotemporal epidemic. IF2 combined with parametric bootstrapping produced superior predictions in all scenarios. S-mapping combined with Dewdrop Regression produced forecasts slightly less-accurate than IF2 and HMC, but demonstrated vastly reduced running times. Hence, S-mapping with or without Dewdrop Regression should be used to glean initial insight into future epidemic behaviour, while IF2 and parametric bootstrapping should be used to refine forecast estimates in time.},

  abstract      = {Highly nonlinear, chaotic or near chaotic, dynamic models are important in fields such as ecology and epidemiology: for example, pest species and diseases often display highly nonlinear dynamics. However, such models are problematic from the point of view of statistical inference. The defining feature of chaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in system states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are two main classes of methods for circumventing these difficulties: information reduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic Likelihood, and state space methods, such as Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, Iterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to compare the methods in order to reach conclusions about how to approach inference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods is universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can suffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model misspecification, leading to bias toward stable dynamics and high process noise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem, but, under the correct model and with sufficient process noise, state space methods lead to substantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More practically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different methods. Our overall conclusion is that model development and checking should probably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning requirements, while for final inference it is likely to be better to switch to a state space method, checking results against the information reduction approach.},

This raises the question of whether dynamic variation in individual sexual behavior is a real phenomenon that can be observed and measured. To study this dynamic variation, we developed a model incorporating heterogeneity in both between-person and within-person sexual contact patterns. Using novel methodology that we call iterated filtering for longitudinal data, we fitted this model by maximum likelihood to longitudinal survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Collaborative HIV Seroincidence Study (1992--1995). We found evidence for individual heterogeneity in sexual behavior over time. We simulated an epidemic process and found that inclusion of empirically measured levels of dynamic variation in individual-level sexual behavior brought the theoretical predictions of HIV incidence into closer alignment with reality given the measured per-act probabilities of transmission. The methods developed here provide a framework for quantifying variation in sexual behaviors that helps in understanding the HIV epidemic among gay men.},

  abstract  = {Identifying mechanisms driving pathogen persistence is a vital component of wildlife disease ecology and control. Asymptomatic, chronically infected individuals are an oft-cited potential reservoir of infection, but demonstrations of the importance of chronic shedding to pathogen persistence at the population-level remain scarce. Studying chronic shedding using commonly collected disease data is hampered by numerous challenges, including short-term surveillance that focuses on single epidemics and acutely ill individuals, the subtle dynamical influence of chronic shedding relative to more obvious epidemic drivers, and poor ability to differentiate between the effects of population prevalence of chronic shedding vs. intensity and duration of chronic shedding in individuals. We use chronic shedding of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) as a case study to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Using leptospirosis-induced strands as a measure of disease incidence, we fit models with and without chronic shedding, and with different seasonal drivers, to determine the time-scale over which chronic shedding is detectable and the interactions between chronic shedding and seasonal drivers needed to explain persistence and outbreak patterns. Chronic shedding can enable persistence of L.{}interrogans within the sea lion population. However, the importance of chronic shedding was only apparent when surveillance data included at least two outbreaks and the intervening inter-epidemic trough during which fadeout of transmission was most likely. Seasonal transmission, as opposed to seasonal recruitment of susceptibles, was the dominant driver of seasonality in this system, and both seasonal factors had limited impact on long-term pathogen persistence. We show that the temporal extent of surveillance data can have a dramatic impact on inferences about population processes, where the failure to identify both short- and long-term ecological drivers can have cascading impacts on understanding higher order ecological phenomena, such as pathogen persistence.},

  abstract  = {In many infectious diseases, an unknown fraction of infections produce symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded, a fact that can seriously compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100. In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity, with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir (free-living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods, which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality, process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology of many infectious diseases.},

This theory complements the growing body of empirical evidence that iterated filtering algorithms provide an effective inference strategy for scientific models of nonlinear dynamic systems. The first step in our theory involves studying a new recursive approach for maximizing the likelihood function of a latent variable model, when this likelihood is evaluated via importance sampling. This leads to the consideration of an iterated importance sampling algorithm which serves as a simple special case of iterated filtering, and may have applicability in its own right.},

Successive reinfection of individuals over a short time interval has been explicitly reported during past pandemics. However, the causes of rapid reinfection and the role of reinfection in driving multiple-wave outbreaks remain poorly understood. To investigate these issues, we focus on a two-wave influenza A/H3N2 epidemic that occurred on the remote island of Tristan da Cunha in 1971. Over 59 days, 273 (96\%) of 284 islanders experienced at least one attack and 92 (32\%) experienced two attacks. We formulate six mathematical models invoking a variety of antigenic and immunological reinfection mechanisms. Using a maximum-likelihood analysis to confront model predictions with the reported incidence time series, we demonstrate that only two mechanisms can be retained: some hosts with either a delayed or deficient humoral immune response to the primary influenza infection were reinfected by the same strain, thus initiating the second epidemic wave. Both mechanisms are supported by previous empirical studies and may arise from a combination of genetic and ecological causes. We advocate that a better understanding and account of heterogeneity in the human immune response are essential to analysis of multiple-wave influenza outbreaks and pandemic planning.},

Influenza virus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several respiratory bacterial pathogens commonly associated with pneumonia. Though clinical evidence supporting this interaction is unambiguous, its population-level effects---magnitude, epidemiological impact and variation during pandemic and seasonal outbreaks---remain unclear. To address these unknowns, we used longitudinal influenza and pneumonia incidence data, at different spatial resolutions and across different epidemiological periods, to infer the nature, timing and the intensity of influenza-pneumonia interaction. We used a mechanistic transmission model within a likelihood-based inference framework to carry out formal hypothesis testing. Irrespective of the source of data examined, we found that influenza infection increases the risk of pneumonia by 100-fold. We found no support for enhanced transmission or severity impact of the interaction. For model-validation, we challenged our fitted model to make out-of-sample pneumonia predictions during pandemic and non-pandemic periods. The consistency in our inference tests carried out on several distinct datasets, and the predictive skill of our model increase confidence in our overall conclusion that influenza infection substantially enhances the risk of pneumonia, though only for a short period.},

In Gillespie's -leap method [D. Gillespie, J. Phys.

This may cause large changes in the populations of certain molecular species during a leap, thereby violating the leap condition. In this paper, we develop an alternative leap method called the K-leap method, in which we constrain the total number of reactions occurring during a leap to be a number K calculated from the leap condition. As the number of firings of each reaction channel during a leap is upper bounded by a properly chosen number, our K-leap method can better satisfy the leap condition, thereby improving simulation accuracy. Since the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) is a special case of our K-leap method when K=1, our K-leap method can naturally change from the exact SSA to an approximate leap method during simulation, whenever the leap condition allows to do so.},

In this context, algorithmic advances have facilitated       likelihood maximization, promoting the study of novel data-motivated       mechanistic models over the last decade. Reviewing these models is the      focus of this paper. In particular, we highlight statistical aspects       of these models like overdispersion, which is key in the interface       between nonlinear infectious disease modeling and data analysis. We       also point out potential directions for further model exploration.},

  abstract  = {Malaria epidemics in regions with seasonal windows of transmission can vary greatly in size from year to year. A central question has been whether these interannual cycles are driven by climate, are instead generated by the intrinsic dynamics of the disease, or result from the resonance of these two mechanisms. This corresponds to the more general inverse problem of identifying the respective roles of external forcings vs. internal feedbacks from time series for nonlinear and noisy systems. We propose here a quantitative approach to formally compare rival hypotheses on climate vs. disease dynamics, or external forcings vs. internal feedbacks, that combines dynamical models with recently developed, computational inference methods. The interannual patterns of epidemic malaria are investigated here for desert regions of northwest India, with extensive epidemiological records for Plasmodium falciparum malaria for the past two decades. We formulate a dynamical model of malaria transmission that explicitly incorporates rainfall, and we rely on recent advances on parameter estimation for nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems based on sequential Monte Carlo methods. Results show a significant effect of rainfall in the inter-annual variability of epidemic malaria that involves a threshold in the disease response. The model exhibits high prediction skill for yearly cases in the malaria transmission season following the monsoonal rains. Consideration of a more complex model with clinical immunity demonstrates the robustness of the findings and suggests a role of infected individuals that lack clinical symptoms as a reservoir for transmission. Our results indicate that the nonlinear dynamics of the disease itself play a role at the seasonal, but not the interannual, time scales. They illustrate the feasibility of forecasting malaria epidemics in desert and semi-arid regions of India based on climate variability. This approach should be applicable to malaria in other locations, to other infectious diseases, and to other nonlinear systems under forcing.},

We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so.

  abstract      = {Mathematical models play a multifaceted role in epidemiology: interpretation and consilience of heterogeneous data, unification of conflicting experimental and observational data, and generation of new hypotheses. Traditional methods based on deterministic assumptions, such as ordinary differential equations (ODE), have been successful in those scenarios. However, "noise" is an intrinsic feature of the cellular/molecular/social world caused by several factors such as measurement error, construct validity, and inherent stochasticity due to small population sizes. Panel data from patients (in the case of infections) or locations (in the case of epidemics) can vary due to intrinsic differences or accidental fluctuations. The use of traditional fitting methods for ODEs applied to noisy problems implies that deviation from some trend can only be due to measurement error or parametric heterogeneity leading to unstable predictions and potentially misguided policies or research programs. In this paper, we quantify the ability of ODEs under different underlying hypotheses (fixed or random effects) to capture individual differences in the underlying data. We explore a simple (exactly solvable) example displaying an initial exponential growth by comparing state-of-the-art stochastic fitting and traditional least squares approximations. We also provide a prescriptive approach for determining the limitations and risks of traditional fitting methodologies. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on the recent 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in Africa.},

The approach we take is one of Fourier analysis, where the complete second-order structure of the FTS is encoded by its spectral density operator, indexed by frequency and curvelength. The comparison is broken down to a hierarchy of stages: at a global level, we compare the spectral density operators of the two FTS, across frequencies and curvelength, based on a Hilbert--Schmidt criterion; then, we localize any differences to specific frequencies; and, finally, we further localize any differences along the length of the random curves, that is, in physical space. A hierarchical multiple testing approach guarantees control of the averaged false discovery rate over the selected frequencies. In this sense, we are able to attribute any differences to distinct dynamic (frequency) and spatial (curvelength) contributions. Our approach is presented and illustrated by means of a case study in molecular biophysics: how can one use molecular dynamics simulations of short strands of DNA to infer their temporal dynamics at the scaling limit, and probe whether these depend on the sequence encoded in these strands?

  abstract  = {Motivation: Computer simulations have become an important tool across the biomedical sciences and beyond. For many important problems several different models or hypotheses exist and choosing which one best describes reality or observed data is not straightforward. We therefore require suitable statistical tools that allow us to choose rationally between different mechanistic models of, e.g. signal transduction or gene regulation networks. This is particularly challenging in systems biology where only a small number of molecular species can be assayed at any given time and all measurements are subject to measurement uncertainty.Results: Here, we develop such a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation and employing sequential Monte Carlo sampling. We show that our approach can be applied across a wide range of biological scenarios, and we illustrate its use on real data describing influenza dynamics and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Bayesian model selection strikes a balance between the complexity of the simulation models and their ability to describe observed data. The present approach enables us to employ the whole formal apparatus to any system that can be (efficiently) simulated, even when exact likelihoods are computationally intractable.Contact: ttoni@imperial.ac.uk; m.stumpf@imperial.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We then use information criteria to evaluate how well these three factors explain the observed patterns of mortality.

Despite sustained high vaccine uptake, a resurgence in pertussis incidence has been reported in a number of countries. This resurgence has led to critical questions regarding the transmission impacts of vaccination and pertussis immunology. We analyzed pertussis incidence in Thailand--both age-stratified and longitudinal aggregate reports--over the past 30 y. To dissect the contributions of waning pertussis immunity and repeat infections to pertussis epidemiology in Thailand following a pronounced increase in vaccine uptake, we used likelihood-based statistical inference methods to evaluate the support for multiple competing transmission models. We found that, in contrast to other settings, there is no evidence for pertussis resurgence in Thailand, with each model examined pointing to a substantial rise in herd immunity over the past 30 y. Using a variety of empirical metrics, we verified our findings by documenting signatures of changing herd immunity over the study period. Importantly, this work leads to the conclusion that repeat infections have played little role in shaping pertussis epidemiology in Thailand. Our results are surprisingly emphatic in support of measurable impact of herd immunity given the uncertainty associated with pertussis epidemiology.},

  abstract  = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as "probes." The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in which we know the ``true'' governing mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well.},

In recent years, social and real-time digital data sources have provided new means of studying disease transmission. Such affordable and accessible data have the potential to offer new insights into disease epidemiology at national and international scales. We used the extensive information repository Google Trends to examine the digital epidemiology of a common childhood disease, chicken pox, caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), over an 11-y period. We (i) report robust seasonal information-seeking behavior for chicken pox using Google data from 36 countries, (ii) validate Google data using clinical chicken pox cases, (iii) demonstrate that Google data can be used to identify recurrent seasonal outbreaks and forecast their magnitude and seasonal timing, and (iv) reveal that VZV immunization significantly dampened seasonal cycles in information-seeking behavior. Our findings provide strong evidence that VZV transmission is seasonal and that seasonal peaks show remarkable latitudinal variation. We attribute the dampened seasonal cycles in chicken pox information-seeking behavior to VZV vaccine-induced reduction of seasonal transmission. These data and the methodological approaches provide a way to track the global burden of childhood disease and illustrate population-level effects of immunization. The global latitudinal patterns in outbreak seasonality could direct future studies of environmental and physiological drivers of disease transmission.},

  abstract  = {Seasonal patterns in cholera dynamics exhibit pronounced variability across geographical regions, showing single or multiple peaks at different times of the year. Although multiple hypotheses related to local climate variables have been proposed, an understanding of this seasonal variation remains incomplete. The historical Bengal region, which encompasses the full range of cholera{\textquoteright}s seasonality observed worldwide, provides a unique opportunity to gain insights on underlying environmental drivers. Here, we propose a mechanistic, rainfall-temperature driven, stochastic epidemiological model which explicitly accounts for the fluctuations of the aquatic reservoir, and analyze with this model the historical dataset of cholera mortality in the Bengal region. Parameters are inferred with a recently developed sequential Monte Carlo method for likelihood maximization in partially observed Markov processes. Results indicate that the hydrological regime is a major driver of the seasonal dynamics of cholera. Rainfall tends to buffer the propagation of the disease in wet regions due to the longer residence times of water in the environment and an associated dilution effect, whereas it enhances cholera resurgence in dry regions. Moreover, the dynamics of the environmental water reservoir determine whether the seasonality is unimodal or bimodal, as well as its phase relative to the monsoon. Thus, the full range of seasonal patterns can be explained based solely on the local variation of rainfall and temperature. Given the close connection between cholera seasonality and environmental conditions, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would allow the better management and planning of public health policies with respect to climate variability and climate change.},

  abstract      = {Second-order statistics such as the variance and autocorrelation can be useful indicators of the stability of randomly perturbed systems, in some cases providing early warning of an impending, dramatic change in the system{\textquoteright}s dynamics. One specific application area of interest is the surveillance of infectious diseases. In the context of disease (re-)emergence, a goal could be to have an indicator that is informative of whether the system is approaching the epidemic threshold, a point beyond which a major outbreak becomes possible. Prior work in this area has provided some proof of this principle but has not analytically treated the effect of imperfect observation on the behavior of indicators. This work provides expected values for several moments of the number of reported cases, where reported cases follow a binomial or negative binomial distribution with a mean based on the number of deaths in a birth-death-immigration process over some reporting interval. The normalized second factorial moment and the decay time of the number of reported cases are two indicators that are insensitive to the reporting probability. Simulation is used to show how this insensitivity could be used to distinguish a trend of increased reporting from a trend of increased transmission. The simulation study also illustrates both the high variance of estimates and the possibility of reducing the variance by averaging over an ensemble of estimates from multiple time series.},

  abstract  = {Statistical inference for mechanistic models of partially observed dynamic systems is an active area of research. Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.},

We fitted models to short observed time series of flour beetle populations in the frequency domain, then used a well fitting stochastic mechanistic model to generate detailed predictions of population spectra. Some predicted spectral peaks represent periodic phenomena induced or modified by stochasticity and were experimentally confirmed. For one experimental treatment, linearization theory explained that these peaks represent overcompensatory decay of deviations from deterministic oscillation. In another treatment, stochasticity caused frequent directional phase shifting around a cyclic attractor. This directional phase shifting was not explained by linearization theory and modified the periodicity of the system. If field systems exhibit directional phase shifting, then changing the intensity of demographic or environmental noise while holding constant the structure of the noise can change the main frequency of population fluctuations.},

  abstract  = {Sustained and coordinated vaccination efforts have brought polio eradication within reach. Anticipating the eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) and the subsequent challenges in preventing its re-emergence, we look to the past to identify why polio rose to epidemic levels in the mid-20\textsuperscript{th} century, and how WPV persisted over large geographic scales. We analyzed an extensive epidemiological dataset, spanning the 1930s to the 1950s and spatially replicated across each state in the United States, to glean insight into the drivers of polio's historical expansion and the ecological mode of its persistence prior to vaccine introduction. We document a latitudinal gradient in polio's seasonality. Additionally, we fitted and validated mechanistic transmission models to data from each US state independently. The fitted models revealed that: (1) polio persistence was the product of a dynamic mosaic of source and sink populations; (2) geographic heterogeneity of seasonal transmission conditions account for the latitudinal structure of polio epidemics; (3) contrary to the prevailing ``disease of development'' hypothesis, our analyses demonstrate that polio's historical expansion was straightforwardly explained by demographic trends rather than improvements in sanitation and hygiene; and (4) the absence of clinical disease is not a reliable indicator of polio transmission, because widespread polio transmission was likely in the multiyear absence of clinical disease. As the world edges closer to global polio eradication and continues the strategic withdrawal of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), the regular identification of, and rapid response to, these silent chains of transmission is of the utmost importance.},

  abstract  = {The case for chaos in childhood epidemics rests on two observations. The first is that historical epidemics show various `fieldmarks' of chaos, such as positive Lyapunov exponents. Second, phase portraits reconstructed from real-world epidemiological time series bear a striking resemblance to chaotic solutions obtained from certain epidemiological models. Both lines of evidence are subject to dispute: the algorithms used to look for the fieldmarks can be fooled by short, noisy time series, and the same fieldmarks can be generated by stochastic models in which there is demonstrably no chaos at all. In the present paper, we compare the predictive abilities of stochastic models with those of mechanistic scenarios that admit to chaotic solutions. The main results are as follows: (i) the mechanistic models outperform their stochastic counterparts; (ii) forecasting efficacy of the deterministic models is maximized by positing parameter values that induce chaotic behaviour; (iii) simple mechanistic models are equal if not superior to more detailed schemes that include age structure; and (iv) prediction accuracy for monthly notifications declines rapidly with time, so that, from a practical standpoint, the results are of little value. By way of contrast, next amplitude maps can successfully forecast successive changes in maximum incidence one or more years into the future.},

  abstract  = {The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for Populations that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids), and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each model to three long-term Population time series in Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field. In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location), the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence.},

  abstract  = {The high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection, arises from the coexistence of over 200 genetically distinct types. Accurately predicting the impact of vaccines that target multiple types requires understanding the factors that determine HPV diversity. The diversity of many pathogens is driven by type-specific or {\textquotedblleft}homologous{\textquotedblright} immunity, which promotes the spread of variants to which hosts have little immunity. To test for homologous immunity and to identify mechanisms determining HPV transmission, we fitted nonlinear mechanistic models to longitudinal data on genital infections in unvaccinated men. Our results provide no evidence for homologous immunity, instead showing that infection with one HPV type strongly increases the risk of infection with that type for years afterward. For HPV16, the type responsible for most HPV-related cancers, an initial infection increases the 1-year probability of reinfection by 20-fold, and the probability of reinfection remains 14-fold higher 2 years later. This increased risk occurs in both sexually active and celibate men, suggesting that it arises from autoinoculation, episodic reactivation of latent virus, or both. Overall, our results suggest that high HPV prevalence and diversity can be explained by a combination of a lack of homologous immunity, frequent reinfections, weak competition between types, and variation in type fitness between host subpopulations. Because of the high risk of reinfection, vaccinating boys who have not yet been exposed may be crucial to reduce prevalence, but our results suggest that there may also be large benefits to vaccinating previously infected individuals.},

Here we used dynamic models of carriage transmission and disease, confronted with detailed IPD incidence data, to elucidate the components and the mechanisms underlying the seasonality of IPDs.

The marked winter seasonality of IPDs is a striking, but still enigmatic aspect of pneumococcal epidemiology in nontropical climates. Here we confronted age-structured dynamic models of carriage transmission and disease with detailed IPD incidence data to test a range of hypotheses about the components and the mechanisms of pneumococcal seasonality. We find that seasonal variations in climate, influenza-like illnesses, and interindividual contacts jointly explain IPD seasonality. We show that both the carriage acquisition rate and the invasion rate vary seasonally, acting in concert to generate the marked seasonality typical of IPDs. We also find evidence that influenza-like illnesses increase the invasion rate in an age-specific manner, with a more pronounced effect in the elderly than in other demographics. Finally, we quantify the potential impact of seasonally timed interventions, a type of control measures that exploit pneumococcal seasonality to help reduce IPDs. Our findings shed light on the epidemiology of pneumococcus and may have notable implications for the control of pneumococcal infections.},

Our framework permits the consideration of implicit dynamic models, meaning statistical models for stochastic dynamical systems which are specified by a simulation algorithm to generate sample paths. Inference procedures that operate on implicit models are said to have the plug-and-play property. Our work builds on recently developed plug-and-play inference methodology for partially observed Markov models. We introduce a class of implicitly specified Markov chains with stochastic transition rates, and we demonstrate its applicability to open problems in statistical inference for biological systems. As one example, these models are shown to give a fresh perspective on measles transmission dynamics. As a second example, we present a mechanistic analysis of cholera incidence data, involving interaction between two competing strains of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae.},

increases in jumps of one (or more) unit(s), even though infinitesimally equi-dispersed processes might be under-, equi- or over-dispersed using previously studied indices. Compound processes arise, for example, when introducing continuous-time white noise to the rates of simple processes resulting in L{\'e}vy-driven SDEs. We construct multivariate infinitesimally over-dispersed compartment models and queuing networks, suitable for applications where moment constraints inherent to simple processes do not hold.},

  abstract  = {We show how a recent framework combining Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with particle filters (PFMCMC) may be used to estimate population state-space models. With the purpose of utilizing the strengths of each method, PFMCMC explores hidden states by particle filters, while process and observation parameters are estimated using an MCMC algorithm. PFMCMC is exemplified by analyzing time series data on a red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) population in New South Wales, Australia, using MCMC over model parameters based on an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We fit three population models to these data; a density-dependent logistic diffusion model with environmental variance, an unregulated stochastic exponential growth model, and a random-walk model. Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities show that there is little support for density dependence and that the random-walk model is the most parsimonious model. The particle filter Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a brute-force method that may be used to fit a range of complex population models. Implementation is straightforward and less involved than standard MCMC for many models, and marginal densities for model selection can be obtained with little additional effort. The cost is mainly computational, resulting in long running times that may be improved by parallelizing the algorithm.},

  abstract      = {While there are many opinions on what mathematical modeling in  biology is, in essence, modeling is a mathematical tool, like a  microscope, which allows consequences to logically follow from a set  of assumptions.  Only when this tool is applied appropriately, as  microscope is used to look at small items, it may allow to  understand importance of specific mechanisms/assumptions in  biological processes.  Mathematical modeling can be less useful or  even misleading if used inappropriately, for example, when a  microscope is used to study stars. According to some philosophers [1],  the best use of mathematical models is not when  a model is used to confirm a hypothesis but rather when a model  shows inconsistency of the model (defined by a specific set of  assumptions) and data.  Following the principle of strong inference  for experimental sciences proposed by Platt [2], I suggest  ``strong inference in mathematical modeling'' as an effective and  robust way of using mathematical modeling to understand mechanisms  driving dynamics of biological systems. The major steps of strong  inference in mathematical modeling are 1) to develop multiple  alternative models for the phenomenon in question; 2) to compare the  models with available experimental data and to determine which of  the models are not consistent with the data; 3) to determine  reasons why rejected models failed to explain the data, and 4) to  suggest experiments which would allow to discriminate between  remaining alternative models.  The use of strong inference is likely  to provide better robustness of predictions of mathematical models  and it should be strongly encouraged in mathematical modeling-based  publications in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century.},

  abstract      = {Yellow fever (YF), transmitted via bites of infected mosquitoes, is a life-threatening viral disease endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and South America. YF has largely been controlled by widespread national vaccination campaigns. Nevertheless, between December 2015 and August 2016, YF resurged in Angola, quickly spread and becoming the largest YF outbreak for the last 30 years. Recently, YF resurged again in Brazil (December 2016). Thus, there is an urgent need to gain better understanding of the transmission pattern of YF. The present study provides a refined mathematical model, combined with modern likelihood-based statistical inference techniques, to assess and reconstruct important epidemiological processes underlying Angola's YF outbreak. This includes the outbreak's attack rate, the reproduction number ([Formula: see text]), the role of the mosquito vector, the influence of climatic factors and the unusual but noticeable appearance of two-waves in the YF outbreak. The model explores actual and hypothetical vaccination strategies, and the impacts of possible human reactive behaviors (e.g., response to media precautions). While there were 73 deaths reported over the study period, the model indicates that the vaccination campaign saved 5.1-fold more people from death and saved from illness 5.6-fold of the observed 941 cases. Delaying the availability of the vaccines further would have greatly worsened the epidemic in terms of increased case numbers and mortality. The analysis estimated a mean [Formula: see text] and an estimated YF attack rate of 0.09-0.15% (proportion of population infected by YFV) over the whole period from December 2015 to August 2016. Our estimated lower and upper bounds of [Formula: see text] are in line with previous studies. Unusually, [Formula: see text] oscillated in a manner that was "delayed" with the reported deaths. High recent number of deaths were associated (followed) with periods of relatively low disease transmission and low [Formula: see text], and vice-versa. The time-series of Luanda's YF cases suggest the outbreak occurred in two waves, a feature that would have become far more prominent had there been no mass vaccination. The waves could possibly be due to protective reactive behavioral changes of the population affecting the mosquito population. The second wave could well be an outcome of the March-April rainfall patterns in the 2016 El Ni{\铨遽怡泸遽糸铉殇遽泔钿轸轱铙骘翳怛邋溟铉镦翳盹篑蹰麸鲥泗矧螽澡盹溴祆轭骝犴鬻矧轶痫麇蜴蹯麸镬骘篝蹁轭骢趱蝈倨屦殇屙殂秕翕蝈犭蟋犷痱秭殇弩忉箝骘骢趱蝈鲠沣轭狒轱汜眇衢珙弼犰踽糸镱螽泔躅趄疹轸邃郁狒弩滹卑背繁觑躜钺飚痤翡鞍岸钡庚珧秕痼痫眇秣铄腴铉後痦殇补吵赴氨糸礤篝犴舶备氨哺缆镲臌令溴蝮镱惫贡糸綮深驽泗轱躞拈箦狍弩镦弱磲铙瘐忪轶桢险鞋遽惫贡狨翳矧令溴蝮镱耶彤犷歪耶彤徜潋弩哮骘蜾秣铄腴铉後糸礤篝犴舶北胺哺懒螋殂戾令溴蝮镱舶氨岈狨翳矧令溴蝮镱叔骀蝈坍糸綮令孱箦礅戾徜牾篝礤铘酸祉犷骈祠弪骘溽翎狍箝黹灬糸镱觑躜钺惋铘桁族狒桢义鲩鬻遽舶氨鲲祯礤辈过铛礅弪辈疳珏哺复补俺盹铘溴悻滹卑北返钡舶按钩ú鞍暴辈辜哺复毫帕似凭伯爱孟徊珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺懒螋殂戾硫蹯犴疳灬聿鞍铂狨翳矧硫蹯犴疳灬憩彤赢犷歪箅屐飕赢犷秋蜾镱萎犷渺狃瓞援糸綮趱麸蜷犰镱疳螋殂戾骈祠弪骘镱扉铄铒铎轭遽颥铒瞽轻躞箝犷箩弩獒铨趄徙腴铉觑躜钺膳排则犷筢泗轱铙镱娱珙犰序镢弩箝铉遽舶安鲲祯礤蛋疳珏狈喘备庚滹卑北肮犯狗赋反珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺懒螋殂戾妈徜蜥舶卑狨翳矧妈徜蜥令轭澌猃糸綮拈筱躞箝镱镦嘈狎糸沆歪螂秭汨衢惋铘冕蜢稞礤翳镤螫怡卯令潋殄觚廉娘蹉弭犷耶蕊戾铙翦轭觑躜钺曙躜钺镦翳绎犰郁狒轶糸汜语汩弭渝蜷弩慢遽舶卑鲲祯礤凡疳珏潮喘潮谍滹卑北北戤贝斗垢陡舶肮鞍烦懂珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺懒螋殂戾妈徜蜥舶北狨翳矧妈徜蜥令轭澌犷娠铋溴蟋配麽蜾坍犷提铄蜷酸蜷钺犷嗅筱踽飕湾蜚邃弩犷嘛蹴岈湾铑犷蔫轫犷裔礤箬卯糸綮歪灬蜷轭铒螋梓弩深溟猃溽翎犷犰箝鲩疳螋獒祆镡箦蝣邃篝镢栳篝殂溟骀弪孱糸犰羼踽糸镱盹溴祗潋轹孱怡帖堙妪鳄铒轶妪觑躜钺曙躜钺镦翳另弪殂犷郁狒轶糸汜馏箫汩狒轱铨遽舶北鲲祯礤卑洱铛礅弪垂待疳珏创碍吹饼滹卑北垢赆筢舶北狃卑巢除珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶贝案背懒螋殂戾买弭锊氨船狨翳矧买弭堙稞冕蜢弩糸綮项殇轱簌钽蜥糸篝镢栳篝殂轸镦骈钺钽獒戾鲥蜥珏彐驽泗簖觑躜钺郁狒轶糸泱犷序镡徕殪轸体趑弪簖遽舶贝鲲祯礤贡铛礅弪褒疳珏舶捕盹铘狨绗滹卑卑倍戤箴飚舶贝按鞍除珧秕痼痫眇脲黠蜾郁镢栳篝殂戾鲥蜥珏裔钿镯麽祀糸礤鲠蝙轭疳蜥礤翦颥物瞽扉铄狎铒瞽轻躞箝犷篝狒瀛箴徙盹溴飕歪轫蹴扉脲扉栾镤弩糸磲糸镱嗅螋殂戾骈祠弪糸礤篝犴舶狈俺俺懒螋殂戾蔑镢璨氨铂狨翳矧蔑镢璎碰犷钱犷蔑铑嗅蹯庐犷澎祛弪郁屦桢挟犷娘怏镱令潋鬻挟犷酗祆镢氍隋铑弭犬糸綮拈箦狍澌钺黹泱轭鏖熹痫瘐灬糸镱蠛盹溴扉铉犷弩糸磲糸镱蝈鲩鬻觑躜钺曙躜钺镦向铋翳镬镧遽舶辈鲲祯礤钡昌铛礅弪昌疳珏锤淡蛋过哌磲螂邃孱趄垭轭玑岷蔟滹卑卑胺蟊俺扯氨碍岸扯除瘐忪轶桢羽蜷铉弪糸礤篝犴舶狈安倍缆镲臌尼鲩箫畋构宫糸綮嘛雉篝蜥湾翳镤犷翳彘琉痨殂狒轱铨瘐忪轶桢冕礅蜷溏疹轹弪箝豉序弩簖遽惫构狨翳矧尼鲩箫瞵廉卯犷乳铍戾漠之徜潋弩冕礅蜷溏五亠螂轶忸暗脖捣捶贝糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺躜梏麴函鼢鳟轶忸箦狎汨矧绡轶忸暗脖捣捶贝懒螋殂戾碰孱箦畋构船狨翳矧碰孱箦瞵清轵糸綮渝聃孱糸犰溽翎狍箝黹灬糸镱鏖翳铒铎轭遽聃狍榄珏矬趄镳栝盹溴躞轭惋铘冕蜢稞礤翳镤麸骘蝈汜篝弪蝻篝狒轶糸泱觑躜钺曙躜钺镦清镳棂箝汜义箦狎汨香遽铙遽惫勾鲲祯礤构铛礅弪玫疳珏卑贝抄卑倍昌滹卑卑补勾拭鞍捣昌珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺缆镲臌碰孱箦畈鞍宫糸綮尼翎馏箝黹灬糸镱澡蓬箦礅戾酸祉犷崎祠弪瘐忪轶桢羽蜷铉弪遽舶肮狨翳矧碰孱箦瞵清轵徜潋弩娘蜾蝈汨五亠螂轶忸扯床俺繁鞍珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺卑躜梏麴函鼢鳟轶忸箦狎汨矧绡轶忸扯床俺繁鞍懒螋殂戾情祆弩痖灞狗丰狨翳矧情祆弩痖瀣漠援糸綮砒徙篝镢栳篝殂箝眭灬糸镱镦泔躔戾汨屙殂犰蝈徙糸镱簖觑躜钺曙躜钺镦需箝汜描屙轶趄遽惫贩鲲祯礤副疳珏渤窗渤侗滹卑卑脖瓯鞍荡搬鞍庚珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺俺缆镲臌秋躜殄蝻貘惫苟糸綮娱眭灬糸镱忉箦陪镱镯弭蜷湾翳镤簖瘐忪轶桢哮骘蜾疹轹弪箝豉序弩簖遽惫狗狨翳矧秋躜檐妪蝻貘卯犷惋铈矧衄廉徜潋弩哮骘蜾轶忸氨垢贩捶党珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺躜梏麴函鼢鳟轶忸箦狎汨矧绡轶忸狗赴惫阜反返待懒螋殂戾儒舶北狨翳矧儒尼殍衢犷孽箬镦娆曙钺翳犷犷尼则稆犷歪术铎轭犷裴蝾尼鲩潺糸綮湾汨犷轶糸盹溴祆轭镦翳翳蝈麽鲥镦翳惫备轭骒蹂铤疳钿屙殂觑躜钺澡屣蝈糸汜陪镬镧遽舶北鲲祯礤待疳珏杯洱滹卑卑胺蟊舶赴氨杯氨渤除珧秕痼痫眇脲黠蜾涕驽鱼殄钽弩糸礤篝犴舶贝岸嘲懒螋殂戾蕊豸咫犴弪惫垢狨翳矧蕊豸咫犴弪绣翦坍犷烷翥桢祆儒蝮汨屐坍糸綮尼翎狍箝黹灬糸镱躞轭犷孱箦礅戾酸祉犷骈祠弪翦汨铋聃妪觑躜钺惋铘桁族狒桢义鲩鬻遽惫垢鲲祯礤辈洱铛礅弪除疳珏饭董副饼滹卑北返钡舶按钩ū构俯辈顶趁胺苟耗琳僚衰撑伯爱孟徊糸礤篝犴舶狈俺俺懒螋殂戾娠铋溴蟛氨贬狨翳矧娠铋溴蟋配麽蜾坍糸綮拈筱躞箝镱镦噜棋狒躜妪歪翥栝铉轭蚤礤渝蜷弩惋溴扉铉Ё怡佼亻猃犷犬燥铉觑躜钺郁狒轶糸汜鱼殄钽妪遽舶北鲲祯礤捕铛礅弪饼疳珏垂挡盹铘驽猬滹卑辈贝北篝蟪吹泯珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺缆镲臌隋屐轭绮鞍宫糸綮惋溴扉铉深驽泗轱躞拈箦狍弩轭弱磲铙犷令轫犰簖瘐忪轶桢序轭沐麸疹轹弪箝豉序弩簖遽舶肮狨翳矧隋屐轭绗彤犷绎栳铋挟徜潋弩序轭沐麸瞵问秣铄腴铉後糸礤篝犴舶倍按钡懒螋殂戾隋蝽徙氡共番狨翳矧桩隋蝽徙犷廉豌隋钿蜷汶糸綮蔑铘蜷怩糸镱麸翳歪翳屙狒殂犰澡屣蝙镦硼殇屙殂簖觑躜钺序镢邋溟铉镦翳绎犰语汩弭镦田钿镱笼遽惫卜鲲祯礤北谍疳珏钒碍凡饼滹卑卑垢蝮疳惫卜氨备秣铄腴铉後糸礤篝犴舶倍俺卜郎蠲镬戾泗轱铥涕醪鞍扁狨翳矧涕醅十犷族篝彤糸綮蔑礅轭轭疳蜥礤翦犷篝狒弩糸磲糸镱轭箝眭灬糸镱忉箦骈祠弪轭琮怙镫糸綮渝聃孱糸犰惋铘冕蜢稞湾翳镤轭序徙糸沐瘐忪轶桢羽蜷铉弪五亠螂遽舶氨邃轸矧娘蹉弭廉犷溴乞彘翎蟋萎犷秋蜾镱萎十疳珏惫翻膊待珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺懒螋殂戾歪蜷畈氨铂狨翳矧歪蜷瞵叔犷烷汨屐犷絮潇铿虚弪蝈犷绎忮螋描蜷篝獒挟犷淫溴颥绎忾十糸綮琉痱秫轫狒箩弩獒铨泔眇豸狒轱钺礤翳镤簖觑躜钺郁狒轶糸泱犷蔑眇豸轭琮遽舶辈鲲祯礤膊铛礅弪洱疳珏北斗北赴滹卑卑胺蟊辈膊氨杯共父昌珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺郎蠲镬戾泗轱铥豌渺邋蝙惫贡狨翳矧豌渺邋蝙耶犬犷绣蝌轭蟋卯彤糸綮沛驽泗镦痱邃狒轱镱翳铛礅弪镦珧遽糸趔苠眇棼嗅蝓磲觑螨怙镫糸綮麻蜾痫瘐灬糸镱篝蹁殄螽义戾鲥钽麸蔑铙弪鲠糸镱犷歪钺珏礤铘瘐忪轶桢哮骘蜾疹轹弪箝豉序弩簖遽惫贡疳珏辈弓贝俘徜潋弩哮骘蜾糸礤篝犴舶狈俺胺懒螋殂戾议汶弪惫荡狨翳矧桩女议汶弪糸綮郁镢犷义泸蹰繇孱酏觑躜钺曙躜钺镦翳崎箬弪殄义箦狎汨嘛狎镦冕钺溽遽惫荡鲲祯礤北疳珏档弓恫除滹卑北彻娴喘俺过骈戾议汶弪惫荡痄婧议汶弪惫荡痄婧心讫秣铄腴铉後糸礤篝犴舶胺俺背懒螋殂戾绎舶辈狨翳矧绎彤犷嘛蹴岈彤十犷娠铋溴蟋女坍犷蔫轫犷耶卯犷嗅筱踽飕彤糸綮澡酗翦铘獒澎轫轭狒轱镦旋灬箜镤轷珠鲠歪灬蜷怡义灬痼则遽繇孱艉升铙殓梏骝镯则犷箜轶箝镱惋溴犷吁蝣彘祆犷沐尼翎骝镯巫升钿獒觑躜钺刑镉五珈邈翦则镳殂犰拈箦狍弩遽舶辈鲲祯礤俘铛礅弪饼疳珏灞狗过滹卑背繁觑躜钺飚痤翡鞍氨狗过珧秕痼痫眇秣铄腴铉後糸礤篝犴舶贝胺泊懒螋殂戾予蝈篝栳舶背狨翳矧予蝈篝栳语躜犷骑磲瞵洛趔犷族轭忮蜱弪尼铋屐彤犷郁彘铄颥渺狨溟犷珠怙蹁密妪汩戾犷绎栳铋绣觏犷糸綮射孱糸纟轭翳轭翦蜥泗轱忮赭邋轭骒蹂铤犷痤艴盹泔沣犰痤艴盹铋躞轭轭汩溴钽溽翎觑躜钺鱼殄钽则犷箪狒轱钺湾溟汩铄遽舶背鲲祯礤谍铛礅弪惫饼疳珏惫彬岣待滹卑北捕筱轸蜥铙祉邃嘲暗垢昌珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶贝胺泊懒螋殂戾禹轸璞构超狨翳矧禹轸璎廉廉糸綮朋糸磲糸铉铒铎轭遽糸礤箦蜷弩盹溴祗躞轭箝眭灬翦鲥泗矧狨麸蝈珧弩箝镱觑躜钺曙躜钺镦琉痨殄陪镱镯弭蜷泱遽惫钩鲲祯礤庚疳珏佣抄痈待糸礤篝犴舶北暗捕懒螋殂戾罪镤舶卑狨翳矧罪镤娱盹萎糸綮郁狒轶糸汜轭驽蝈钽骘铒轶铒铎轭遽邈镬镧殂犰澌钺黹簌篝屙簖觑躜钺吾趱蝈遽舶卑鲲祯礤炊洱疳珏北安北按盹铘狨绗轶箢贝范炊阜滹卑卑掣钺趱蝈肮潮过珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺脖懒螋殂戾亻岵氨爆狨翳矧亻岈匍铉沲犷燥铉蕊麇祆糸綮棋狒躜磲翥栝铉轭糸礤箦蜷弩盹溴扉铉觑躜钺郁狒轶糸汜鱼殄钽妪遽舶北鲲祯礤捕铛礅弪饼疳珏脖炊盹铘驽猬哌磲螂邃孱趄垭轭玑岷蔟滹卑辈贝卑篝蟪吹珧秕痼痫眇糸礤篝犴舶狈俺案烂镯礤铘赆怛彐礤翎溽翎忉箦赠疱衡殁翦积烂镯礤铘赆怛彐礤翎珧秕痖铉领炫铘蜷弩球秕鸷隋黠蜾球秕鸷痫眇芑败荤蝻躔筌火镯疖话芑败槐芑芑芑芑烂镯礤铘赆怛彐礤翎筢鲥零糸镱蠛孱徕戾浠溽翦垲矧磲扉暹溽翦邃轸矧埘铋泔溴唪镞灬翦疳珏筵铒蝽犰辁暹疳珏哳蹴忮蝮觑躜钺燠躅殂镤暹麸哽狒屮盹铘枸铒蝽犰辁暹盹铘栎狨翳矧埘铋泔溴唪镞灬翦犰飙翦舡骈屐潴埏蜾轭犰筮麸唧躔弪筱蜷痿徕篝蜥泗坭繇爝麸哽狒屮躅殂镤暹麸哽狒屮怙镫糸綮遨躅殂镤暹麸哽狒屮积烂镯礤铘赆怛彐礤翎筢鲥向溴蛎镱骈绾箴邈殒殄浠脲绘犰箦会怏趄徙艋驷祗寤徕篝蜥泗绘犰箦积
