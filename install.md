# Installation instructions

## From Github:

The github version is usually several weeks ahead of the version on CRAN.
You can install it from the Github repository by executing the following in an **R** session:  
```
install.packages("pomp",repos="https://kingaa.github.io/")
```  
On Windows and MacOSX systems, this will cause a precompiled version of the latest release of **pomp** to be installed.

You can also download [the source tarball](https://github.com/kingaa/pomp/releases/) of the latest release and install it locally as you would any **R** package.

## From CRAN:

Source and binaries for the [CRAN version are available here](http://cran.r-project.org/package=pomp){:target="_blank"}.

Install **pomp** from CRAN just like any other **R** package:
```
install.packages("pomp")
```

## Important note for Windows users

To make use of **pomp**'s facilities for accelerated computation using compiled C code, and to compile the package from source, you will need the ability to compile C code and dynamically link it into an **R** session.
For this reason, you must install the **Rtools** suite, which can be [downloaded from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools){:target="_blank"}.
**Rtools** is needed *both* to compile and install the development version from source *and* to obtain full value from any version of the package.

Note that, after installing **Rtools**, it is necessary to edit the system path, as [described here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/#putting-rtools-on-the-path){:target="_blank"}, so that these tools can be found by the operating system.

A video tutorial on installing **Rtools** is [available here](https://youtu.be/lmIhiT_QsPE){:target="_blank"}.

To test your ability to compile C and FORTRAN code, run the following in an **R** session:
```
source("https://kingaa.github.io/scripts/hello.R",echo=TRUE)
```
This script attempts to compile two simple programs, one in C and one in FORTRAN.
Upon success, you'll see two "Hello!" messages.


## Important note for Mac OS X users

To make use of the package facilities for accelerated computation using compiled C code, you will need the ability to compile C code and dynamically link it into an **R** session.
These facilities are provided in the <code>Xcode</code> app, which is free and can be installed via the App Store or downloaded from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/){:target="_blank"}.

Some users report problems installing **pomp** from source due to lack of an appropriate **gfortran** installation, which is not included by default in all versions of **Xcode**.
If you have this problem, see [these instructions](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/){:target="_blank"}.

To test your ability to compile C and FORTRAN code, run the following in an **R** session:
```
source("https://kingaa.github.io/scripts/hello.R",echo=TRUE)
```
This script attempts to compile two simple programs, one in C and one in FORTRAN.
Upon success, you'll see two "Hello!" messages.

## Important note for Linux users

You may need to install the `gfortran` compiler on your machine, if it is not already there.
For example, on a Debian-based system (e.g., Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt install gfortran
```
On an RPM-based system:
```
sudo yum install gcc-gfortran
```

## Changes from version 1:

**pomp** version 2 introduced a number of changes that were not compatible with earlier versions.
This means that code that ran under versions &lt;2 may break under up-to-date versions of **pomp**.
An [upgrade guide](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/upgrade_guide.html){:target="_blank"} is available to help you transition your codes to the new version.
