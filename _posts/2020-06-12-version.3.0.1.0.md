**pomp** version 3.0.1.0 has been released: source code and binaries are available.
This is a development release, anticipatory to the next CRAN version, which will be 3.1.

From this version, **pomp** requires at least version 4.0 of **R**.

#### New features

A new sequential importance sampling algorithm has been implemented as `wpfilter`.
This is a generalization of the algorithm in `pfilter` in that it tracks the weights of the particles and allows the user to customize the resampling scheme.
In particular, one can determine when resampling happens using the `trigger` option.
One sets `trigger` to a positive number:
when the effective sampling size is less than `trigger * Np`, resampling is triggered.
Thus setting `trigger = 0` forbids resampling, while setting `trigger` to any number &ge;0 forces resampling at every observation *a la* `pfilter`.

One can also determine the weight distribution of the resampled particles using the `target` option.
One sets `target` to a number in [0,1].
If `target = `&alpha;, say, and the weight of the i-th particle is w<sub>i</sub>, then it is resampled with weight w<sub>i</sub><sup>1-&alpha;</sup> and, after resampling, carries weight w<sub>i</sub><sup>&alpha;</sup>.

Thus, setting `trigger = 1` and `target = 0` reproduces the behavior of `pfilter`.

The new function `wpfilter` should be considered an alpha release:
both the interface and the underlying algorithms may change at any time without notice.
Please explore the function and give feedback via the **pomp** [issues page](https://github.com/kingaa/pomp/issues/).
