title: pomp version 2.2 released to CRAN
---

**pomp** version 2.2 has been released to CRAN and is on its way to a mirror near you.
This release adds one new feature: it is now possible to create diagnostic plots by calling `plot` directly on the objective functions created by `probe_objfun` and `spect_objfun`.
In addition, a small but annoying bug in `profileDesign`, when the new option `type="runif"` is used, has been fixed.
