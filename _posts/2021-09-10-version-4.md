title: version 4 is on the way

Version 4.0.0.0 of **pomp** is now [available on the the package github repo](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/).

This release contains a few backwardly incompatible changes, which are explained here.
All of these have to do with the elementary function [`trajectory`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/trajectory.html), which computes trajectories of the deterministic dynamical skeleton.

- The behavior of `trajectory` now fully conforms to the behavior of other `pomp` [elementary functions](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/elementary_algorithms.html).
  In particular, one can now add, remove, or modify basic model components in a call to `trajectory` just as one can with `simulate`, `pfilter`, `probe`, etc.
  Before version 4, additional arguments to `trajectory` (i.e., those passed via `...`) were passed on to the ODE integrator in the case of continuous-time deterministic skeletons (i.e., vectorfields) and ignored in the case of discrete-time skeletons (i.e., maps).
  As of version 4, in order to adjust ODE integrator settings it is necessary to use the `ode_control` argument of `trajectory`.
  This behavior matches that of [`traj_objfun`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/traj_match.html).
    
- It is now possible to create a `pomp` object from scratch using `trajectory`, together with a specification of the rinit and skeleton components.
  Prior to version 4, in order to do so, it was necessary to somewhat awkwardly first create a dummy data set, then call `pomp`, and then pass the resulting `pomp` object to `trajectory`.
  This can now be achieved in one call.

- The user now has the option, in a call to `trajectory`, to have the results returned as one or `pomp` objects.
  In this regard, its behavior matches that of `simulate`.
