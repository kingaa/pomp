I'm looking for a volunteer who can maintain the **pomp** installation instructions for Mac users.
Personally, I work pretty much exclusively on linux machines.
I think I'm more or less able to keep up with the Windows installation instructions, but with respect to the Mac, I'm not keeping up.
It seems I turned around and several things changed at once.

If there's a Mac user out there, a veteran installer of **pomp**, who can edit/augment the [Mac installation instructions](install.html#important-note-for-mac-os-x-users) on an ongoing basis, to keep up with [advice from the **R** core team](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), probably including revising or replacing the [gfortran installation instructions](https://kingaa.github.io/mac-fortran.html), it would a great service to the **pomp** community!

Please [contact me](mailto:kingaa@umich.edu) if you're interested.
