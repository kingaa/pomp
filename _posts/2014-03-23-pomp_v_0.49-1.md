**pomp** version 0.49-1 is now available on CRAN and coming soon to a mirror near you.

<!--more-->

This is a new feature release.  Some highlights are:

- A new method, `probe.match.objfun`, constructs objective functions suitable for use in optimizers.
    
- Inference methods based on optimization can now use the `nloptr` package, which provides a suite of optimization algorithms.

- The new `abc` method implements Approximate Bayesian Computation for pomp models.

- New inline C functions `to_log_barycentric` and `from_log_barycentric` are provided in *pomp.h* to facilitate log-barycentric transformations. 
  These have proven very useful in dealing with parameters constrained to sum to one (e.g., initial conditions of compartmental models).

- Pomp objects now contain `dprior` and `rprior` slots. 
  These are used by the Bayesian methods (`abc`, `bsmc`, and `pmcmc`).
  The old `hyperparams` argument to these methods has been removed; 
  hyperparameters are now treated just as any others.

- By default, `pompBuilder` now creates all files in the temporary directory.
  Use the `save=TRUE` option to get the old behavior.

- The vignettes are no longer available via the `vignette()` command but can be reached via the HTML documentation, in the `doc` directory, and online at https://kingaa.github.io/pomp
