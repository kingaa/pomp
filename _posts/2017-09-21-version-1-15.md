title: pomp version 1.15 released
---

**pomp** version 1.15 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pomp) and is coming soon to a mirror near you.
This release fixes errors that would have arisen in **R** version 3.5 due to new changes in the underpinnings of **R**.

Additionally, there has been one augmentation of the **pomp** C API: a new `dmultinom` function for multinomial likelihoods.
See the [package NEWS](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/NEWS/) for more details.
