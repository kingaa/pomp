title: pomp version 1.11 released
---

**pomp** version 1.11 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pomp).
This release introduces one new feature, fixes some bugs, and improves the documentation.

## New feature

The functions `bake`, `stew`, and `freeze` now preserve information about the system time used in computation as an attribute of the returned object.
Another attribute stores information about the RNG settings used.

## Other changes

- Some documentation improvements, including better documentation of the adaptive MCMC proposal (`mvn.rw.adaptive`), courtesy of Sebastian Funk.
- More verbosity is provided with `verbose=TRUE`, especially during Csnippet building.
- Better handling of the `pomp` `times` argument, avoiding some potentially buggy behavior.
- Internally, routines called by `.Call` are now registered.
