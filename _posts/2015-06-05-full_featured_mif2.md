A full-featured version of IF2, an [improved iterated filtering algorithm](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1410597112), is now available as `mif2`.  
This allows a more general structure for the random perturbations applied to parameters and is generally more efficient and stable than IF1.
`mif2` should be preferable to `mif` in just about all circumstances.
