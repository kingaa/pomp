**pomp** version 1.9 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pomp/index.html).
This release fixes several bugs.

### Bug fixes

- During particle filtering, when non-finite `dmeasure` values are generated, an error is generated and the offending parameters, states, data, and time are reported.
  In methods that use parameter transformations (`transform=TRUE`), the reported parameters were on the transformed (estimation) scale, which can be confusing.
  The error message now gives the parameters on the natural (model) scale.
- A bug in `mif2` arising when filtering fails in the final timestep has been fixed.
  In this case, when all particles are deemed inconsistent with the data, we use an unweighted mean (with a warning) in place of the default weighted mean.

Please see the package [**NEWS**](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/NEWS.html) for more details.
