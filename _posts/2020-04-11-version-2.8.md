title: version 2.8 released

**pomp** version 2.8 has been released to CRAN and is on its way to a mirror near you.

#### Important Changes

- As promised with version 2.4.1.3, the default value of `tol` in the particle-filtering algorithms `pfilter`, `pmcmc`, `mif2`, and `bsmc2` has been changed to zero. 
  A warning continues to be issued if `tol` is set to anything other than 0.
  In a future release, the option to choose a nonzero tolerance will be removed entirely.
  ***This change is not backward compatible.***
  If precise reproduction of old results is needed, set the `tol` parameter to the appropriate nonzero value.

- In traces and diagnostic plotting methods, the `nfail` variable (tracking numbers of filtering failures) has been dropped.

#### Minor change

- The Euler step size in `sir` is now adjustable by means of the argument `delta`.
