The [*Journal of Statistical Software* paper that announced **pomp**](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v069.i12) has been thoroughly revised to bring it up to date with the changes in syntax and in algorithms that have happened since that paper first appeared.
The paper introduces the rationale for, and structure of, the package.
It gives pseudocode for several of **pomp**'s estimation algorithms and uses examples to demonstrate and compare these methods.
