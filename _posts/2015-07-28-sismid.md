layout: pomp
---

Ed Ionides and Aaron King taught a short course on this topic at the [7th Summer Institute for Statistics and Modeling for Infectious Disease](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sismid/) at the University of Washington in Seattle this summer.
The materials include:
<!--more-->

- an introduction to POMP models,
- essential of stochastic simulation with emphasis on the stochastic Euler algorithm,
- a tutorial on the theory and practice of the particle filter,
- an introduction to iterated filtering, and
- four cases studies illustrating **pomp** methods:
    - understanding polio's persistence, replicating some of the results in [a recent PLoS Biology paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002172),
    - revisiting [measles dynamics in England and Wales](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2009.0151) to see what full-information methods reveal,
    - a longitudinal study of sexual behavior changes that illustrates how **pomp** and `mif2` can be used to fit models to panel data, drawn from [another recent paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwv044), and
    - a study showing illustrating model diagnostics and forecasting methods in the context of the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, again based on [a recent paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.0347).
