title: version 2.7.1.0 available on github

Version 2.7.1.0 makes the first set of changes to the behavior of particle-filter-based algorithms promised in version 2.4.1.0.
In particular, the default value of the `tol` parameter is now set to zero.
This affects the `pfilter`, `mif2`, `pmcmc`, and `bsmc2` functions.

See [the earlier blog post for more information](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/archive.html#version-2-5-released).

If you haven't changed your workflow to use `tol=0`, as prompted by the warnings from versions 2.4.1 on, this change may break some of your existing code.
To recover previous behavior, set `tol` to a positive value (the old default was 10<sup>-17</sup>).
It is a good idea at this stage, however, to modify your workflows by setting `tol=0` or, better still, leaving `tol` at the default value, since the `tol` argument will go away soon.

In a forthcoming release, the option to set a nonzero tolerance will be removed entirely.
