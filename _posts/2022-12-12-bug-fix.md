title: deterministic trajectory computation bug fixed
---
    
[Release 4.4.3.0](https://github.com/kingaa/pomp/releases/tag/4.4.3.0) fixes a bug in trajectory computation for deterministic, discrete-time maps.
Thanks to Felicia Magpantay for finding the bug and reporting it!

In addition, this release includes

- changes that allow one to extract *weighted* as well as unweighted particles from a [`pfilter` computation](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/saved_states.html) and
- changes to the [`wquant` function](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/wquant.html) for estimating quantiles given weighted samples.

As ever, the release can be installed by executing

> install.packages("pomp",repos="https://kingaa.github.io")

in an **R** session.
