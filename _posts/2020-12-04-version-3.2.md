title: version 3.2 released
---

**pomp** version 3.2 has been released to CRAN and will be available soon [at a mirror near you](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
This release contains relatively minor improvements, primarily to the documentation.

The only significant user-visible changes concern the functions `profileDesign`, `sliceDesign`, `runifDesign`, and `sobolDesign`, which have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
They are replaced by `profile_design`, `slice_design`, `runif_design`, and `sobol_design`, respectively.

In addition, the behavior of `profile_design` has changed.
Previously, the same random (`type="runif"`) or sub-random (`type="sobol"`) sequence was used for all non-profile parameters.
The new behavior is that, for each profile slice, a distinct set of points is generated.
