title: version 3.1.1.1 released
---

**pomp** development version 3.1.1.1 has just been released on the package github site.
This release introduces the `profile_design` function, which is intended to replace `profileDesign`.
The so-called profile design consists of a series of slices through a parameter space perpendicular to one or more coordinate axes.
The old behavior was to generate a single set of points in one of these slices (randomly according to a uniform distribution when `type="runif"` and according to a sub-random (Sobol') sequence when `type="sobol"`) and then copy these points across all slices.
Thus, in a projection perpendicular to the slices, all `nprof` generated points would lie atop one another.
The new behavior is to generate the points in each slice independently.
Thus, a projection perpendicular to the slices will display `n*nprof` points, where `n` is the number of slices.

For stylistic reasons, the other design functions, `sliceDesign`, `runifDesign`, and `sobolDesign` have been replaced by `slice_design`, `runif_design`, and `sobol_design`, respectively.

The older functions remain in place, but are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
