title: pomp version 6.3 released

**pomp** version 6.3 has been released to CRAN and will soon appear on [a mirror near you](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
This release contains a relatively minor feature upgrade: the built-in [examples](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/pomp_examp.html) that use simulated data now have a `seed` argument.
One can adjust this argument to generate distinct datasets.
