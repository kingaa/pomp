title: pomp version 2.1 released to CRAN
---

I have just released **pomp** version 2.1 to CRAN.
For the last six months, this has been available on [the **pomp** website](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/) as the package **pomp2**.

Because it is not fully backward-compatible, **pomp** version 2 is being made available temporarily as the **pomp2** package.
Hopefully, most of you will have been using **pomp2** for some time now, but if you find yourself needing to update old codes and workflows for the new version, have a look at the [upgrade guide](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/upgrade_guide.html),
which summarizes all the changes in version 2.

If you have **pomp2** on your system, you should now remove it entirely, and replace all references to **pomp2** in your codes with references to **pomp**.

As always, please don't hesitate to bring questions, conundrums, puzzles, paradoxes, bugs, and feature requests, to my attention via by [raising an Issue](https://github.com/kingaa/pomp/issues/).
