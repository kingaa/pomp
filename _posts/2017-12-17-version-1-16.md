---

**pomp** version 1.16 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pomp) and is coming soon to a mirror near you.
This release includes new features and bug fixes.

Highlights include:

- A new facility, gillespie.hl.sim, allows implementation of Gillespie's algorithm for exact stochastic simulation of continuous-time Markov processes via a streamlined C snippet interface.
  The old facility for Gillespie simulations, gillespie.sim, now accepts C snippets for faster calculation of event rates.
  Thanks to Eamon O'Dea for this new functionality!
- The bug in `traj.match`, reported in issue #57 has been fixed.
  Thanks to Yue Wu for identifying and helping fix the bug!
- An error arising when building pomp objects with Csnippets in certain Windows configurations has been fixed.
- Issue #56, in which covariate names are discarded when coercing a pomp object to a data frame, has been fixed.
  Thanks to Eamon O'Dea for reporting this bug!
