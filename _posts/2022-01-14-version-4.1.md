title: version 4.1 released to CRAN
---
    
Version 4.1 of **pomp** is now on CRAN and coming soon to [a mirror near you](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
This release contains quite a number of changes, including new features, some user-interface improvements, and some changes to the examples provided with the package.
As the increment to the major version number suggests, a few of these changes are not backwardly compatible with versions 3.X.

### New features

#### Monte Carlo-adjusted profile likelihood

- Computation of Monte Carlo-adjusted profile likelihood is now facilitated by the new [`mcap`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/mcap.html) function.

#### Deterministic trajectories and trajectory matching

- The behavior of [`trajectory`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/trajectory.html) now fully conforms to the behavior of other **pomp** [elementary algorithms](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/elementary_algorithms.html).
In particular, one can now add, remove, or modify basic model components in a call to `trajectory` just as one can with `simulate`, `pfilter`, `probe`, etc.
Before version 4, additional arguments to `trajectory` (i.e., those passed via `...`) were passed on to the **deSolve** ODE integrator in the case of continuous-time deterministic skeletons (i.e., vectorfields) and ignored in the case of discrete-time skeletons (i.e., maps).
As of version 4, in order to adjust ODE integrator settings it is necessary to use the `ode_control` argument of `trajectory`.
This behavior matches that of [`traj_objfun`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/traj_match.html).

- It is now possible to create a 'pomp' object from scratch using `trajectory`, by specifying the [rinit](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/rinit_spec.html) and [skeleton](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/skeleton_spec.html) components.
Prior to version 4, in order to do so, it was necessary to first create a dummy data set, make a call to `pomp`, and pass the resulting object to `trajectory`.
This can now be achieved in one call, just as in the other [elementary algorithms](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/elementary_algorithms.html).

- In a call to [`trajectory`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/trajectory.html), the user now has the option to have the results returned as one or 'pomp' objects.
This is controlled by the `format` argument as in [`simulate`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/simulate.html).
The default return-value format for `trajectory` now matches that of `simulate`.

#### Ensemble Kalman filter methods

- Two new [basic model components](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/basic_components.html) have been introduced.
These are:
  - [emeasure](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/emeasure_spec.html), which computes the expectation of the observable variables conditional on the latent state;
  - [vmeasure](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/vmeasure_spec.html), which computes the covariance matrix of the observables given the latent state.

- The ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (`eakf`) has been refactored.
It now makes use of the new [emeasure](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/emeasure_spec.html) and [vmeasure](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/vmeasure_spec.html) [basic components](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/basic_components.html) to compute an approximation of the linear relationship between the latent state and the observed variables.

- The basic (linear, Gaussian) Kalman filter is now available as [`kalmanFilter`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/kf.html).

### User interface changes

- It is now possible to plot lists of 'pomp' and 'pomp'-derived objects using a single call to [`plot`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/plot.html).

- The `rbetabinom` and `dbetabinom` functions, long present as part of the C API, are now [available as R functions](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/betabinom.html).

- [`parmat`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/parmat.html) can now take a data frame of parameters and convert it into a matrix suitable for furnishing to the `params` argument of any **pomp** function.
Also, `parmat` now takes an optional argument, `names`, which allows the user to name the parameter sets.

- It is now possible to adjust the parameters in an `objfun` (objective function) object using [`coef(object)<-value`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/coef.html) as with 'pomp' objects.

- The [`forecast`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/forecast.html) method now works for 'pfilterd_pomp' objects (i.e., results of `pfilter`, `pmcmc`, or `mif2` computations).

- Independent realizations of the stochastic processes modeled in **pomp** are now distinguished by different values of the variable `.id`.
This behavior is now uniform throughout the package.

- [`bake` and `stew`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/bake.html) now send messages instead of warnings when they recompute an archive due to a change in code or dependencies.

- The names of the variables returned by `as.data.frame`, as applied to a `pfilterd.pomp` object, have changed.

### Changes to examples

- The SIR examples `sir()` and `sir2()` now use a negative binomial measurement model, in keeping with practices we have been recommending in our [short course](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/).
