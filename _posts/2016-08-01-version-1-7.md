title: pomp version 1.7 is released
---

**pomp** version 1.7 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pomp/index.html).
This is a bug-fix and documentation upgrade.
Since version 1.6, I have continued to improve the handling of error messages and warnings.
Please continue to send examples of error messages that are uninformative or misinformative, along with the code that produced them, so I can trap those errors and improve the messages!

Please see the package [**NEWS**](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/NEWS.html) for more details.
