title: pomp version 1.17 released
---

**pomp** version 1.17 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pomp) and is coming soon to a mirror near you.
This release includes bug fixes and some feature enhancements.

Highlights include:



- On all platforms, messages from the compiler resulting from attempts to compile C snippets are now displayed only in the event of an error.
  Setting `verbose=TRUE` forces display of these messages.
- `spect.match` has been refactored, with small changes to the interface.
- `coef<-` can now take a list of parameters:
  it applies `unlist` to turn the list into a numeric vector.
- Behind the scenes, many of the codes have been reworked for better stability.

See the [package NEWS](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/NEWS/) for more details.
