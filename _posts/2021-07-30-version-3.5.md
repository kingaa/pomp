title: version 3.5 released

**pomp** version 3.5 has been released to CRAN and will be available soon [at a mirror near you](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
The main feature upgrade concerns the reproducibility functions `bake` and `stew`, which cache calculation results.
In previous versions, if the calculation was modified, or if any of its dependencies changed, it was necessary to manually delete the cache file to force recomputation.
In the new release, these functions now now silently cache information about the calculation and its dependencies.
If these are modified, recomputation is triggered.
In addition, the user now has more control over the information that is returned.
See [the package manual](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/manual/pomp/help/bake.html) for more details.

This release also fixes a bug in `bsmc2` and upgrades the `partrans` function to make it easier to use with objective functions.

See [the package NEWS](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/NEWS.html) for full details.
