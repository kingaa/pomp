In version 1.3.1.1, several features that had long been deprecated have been removed.
These include:

- the `seed` argument to `pfilter`.
  Use `freeze` to obtain similar functionality.
- the redundant `pars` argument to `mif` has been removed.
- the old `parameter.transform` and `parameter.inv.transform` arguments to `pomp`.
  In version 0.65-1, these were superseded by the `fromEstimationScale` and `toEstimationScale` arguments.

Please see the package [**NEWS**](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/NEWS/) for more details.
