**pomp** version 2.4 has been released to CRAN and is on its way to a mirror near you.
In this release, the source codes underlying specification of basic model components via **R** functions has been reworked to remove reliance on deep `PROTECT` stacks.
No changes will be visible to the user.
Thanks to Thomas Kalibera for showing the way!
Additionally, a bug in the documentation for `filter.traj`, pointed out by Pierre Jacob, has been fixed.
