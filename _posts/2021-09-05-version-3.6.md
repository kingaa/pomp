**pomp** version 3.6 has been released to CRAN and will be available soon [at a mirror near you](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
This release features improvements in the package manual, a few bug fixes, and some feature upgrades.

Highlights include:

- Improvements to [the package manual](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/manual), including more examples, richer cross-linking, and better organization.
- When [`simulate`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/simulate.html) is called with `format="data.frame"` and `include.data=TRUE`, the interpolated covariates are now included in the data frame that is returned.
- Stateful objective functions created by [`traj_objfun`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/traj_match.html), [`nlf_objfun`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/nlf.html), [`probe_objfun`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/probe_match.html), and [`spect_objfun`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/spect_match.html) now have default arguments.
  In particular, the default is argument is a zero-length numeric vector.
  Calling such a function with no arguments is valid if and only if the objective function was created with no variables to estimate (empty `est`).
- The stateful objective function created by [`traj_objfun`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/traj_match.html) has been refactored so that it is independent of [`trajectory`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/trajectory.html). 
  This change is invisible to the user, but lays the groundwork for future changes in [`trajectory`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/trajectory.html).
- The workhorse function [`flow`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/flow.html) now has default arguments.
- The [`states`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/states.html) and [`obs`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/obs.html) methods now work for lists of `pomp` objects (`listies`).
- A bug in [`rprior`](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/prior_spec.html) arising with integer-valued return vectors has been fixed.
