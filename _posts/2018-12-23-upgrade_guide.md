[The **pomp** Version 2 Upgrade Guide](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/upgrade_guide.html) has been revised.
It now includes before-and-after examples of codes rewritten for **pomp** version 2.
This is meant to help you revise **pomp** version <2 codes to take advantage of the new features.

As a reminder, an alpha-release preview of **pomp** version 2 is available as **pomp2** on [the **pomp** website](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/).
Do
```
install.packages("pomp2",repos="https://kingaa.github.io")
```
to install it.
It is possible to have both **pomp** (version <2) and **pomp2** installed simultaneously during workflow migration.

Around the middle of 2019, **pomp2** will be renamed **pomp** and uploaded to CRAN as version 2.1.
From that point forward, there will be no support for older versions of **pomp**.
