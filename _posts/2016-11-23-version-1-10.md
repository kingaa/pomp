title: pomp version 1.10 released
---

**pomp** version 1.10 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pomp/index.html).
This release removes some deprecated facilities and provides one new feature.

### Deprecated facilities removed

- The deprecated options to supply a matrix or numeric vector as the `data` argument to `pomp` have been removed and an error is now generated.
  `data` must now be provided either as a data frame or as an object of class `pomp`.
  See `?pomp` for details.
- The deprecated `skeleton.type` and `skelmap.delta.t` arguments to `pomp` have been removed.
  Using these arguments will now generate an error message.
  To specifying the deterministic skeleton, one now must use the `skeleton=map()` or `skeleton=vectorfield()` syntax.
  This is explained in more detail in the help pages (`?pomp`).

### New feature

- There is now a `logLik` method defined for `pmcmcList` objects.

See the package [**NEWS**](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/NEWS/) for more details.
