**pomp** version 0.53-1 is now available on CRAN and coming soon to a mirror near you.

This is a major new feature release.
Some highlights are:

- It is now much easier to accelerate code through the use of compiled code.  
  **pomp** can now take snippets of C code directly as definitions of the various basic functions. This is accomplished through the use of a new Csnippet function. See the "sir" demo for a demonstration.

- Features that facilitate multiple PMCMC and ABC chains have been added.
  There are `c` methods to combine `abc` and `pmcmc` objects. 
  Running `conv.rec` on an `abc`, `pmcmc`, `abcList`, or `pmcmcList` object now produces **coda** `mcmc` and `mcmc.list` objects, respectively. 
  Diagnostic plots are produced by running `plot` on such objects. 
  Package **coda** is now a dependency of **pomp**.
  This package provides various generic MCMC diagnostics.

- The `transform` argument for `pmcmc` and `abc` has been removed.

- `nlf` now returns an S4 object of class `nlfd.pomp` with a `logLik` method for extracting the log quasi likelihood and a `$` method for extracting arbitrary components.  
  It thus behaves like **pomp**&apos;s other inference methods.

- The package manual and tutorials are no longer included with the package source. 
  Instead, links are provided to the pomp website.
  The package help pages have been revisited for accuracy and completeness.
