title: pomp version 1.14 released
---

**pomp** version 1.14 is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pomp) and is coming soon to a mirror near you.
This release fixes a bug in `gillespie.sim` and removes the `kleap.sim` plug-in.

A new feature: the new argument `hmax` to `gillespie.sim` allows the user to specify the maximum step size that will be taken before covariates are evaluated.

The K-leap method has been removed because its accuracy on test problems is low and it is difficult to make it compatible with the **pomp** paradigm.
In particular, it does not readily accomodate time-varying covariates in a sensible way, nor does it lend itself to simulations at pre-specified times.

See the [package NEWS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pomp/news.html) for more details.
