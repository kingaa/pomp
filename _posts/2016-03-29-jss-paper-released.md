A [*Journal of Statistical Software* paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v069i12) describing **pomp**, its rationale, structure, and the inference algorithms it contains, has just been released.
[The paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v069.i12) gives the inference algorithms in detail (including pseudocode), and demonstrates them on a few examples.
Its aim is to give an introduction **pomp** both as a scientific tool and as a platform for development of inference methods for POMPs.
Please cite this paper (do `citation("pomp")` in an **R** session to see how) when you use the package.
