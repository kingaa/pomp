title: pomp version 2 released as pomp2
---

Version 2 of **pomp**, with major improvements, is on its way!
Because it is not fully backward-compatible, **pomp** version 2 is being made available temporarily as the **pomp2** package.
**pomp2** is not available on CRAN but source and binaries can be downloaded from [the **pomp** website](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/).
See the [installation page](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/install.html) for instructions.

**pomp2** will be phased out, replaced by version 2 of **pomp**, around the middle of 2019.
At that point, **pomp** versions <2 will no longer be supported.

***It is recommended that users begin making the transition to version 2 now***.
An [upgrade guide](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/upgrade_guide.html) is available to help you transition your codes to the new version.
In the interim period, you can have both **pomp** and **pomp2** installed on your system simultaneously.
