  \itemize{
    \item Minor corrections to documentation.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.5.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item C-level functions \code{set_pomp_userdata} and \code{unset_pomp_userdata} are no longer exported.
    \item \code{bspline_eval} is no longer exported.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.4.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item C-level functions \code{set_pomp_userdata} and \code{unset_pomp_userdata} have been temporarily restored.
    The latter generates a warning.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.4.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item There is now access to ordinary B-spline basis functions (and their derivatives) at the C snippet level.
    It will still almost always be preferable to construct a spline basis once and pass it to \pkg{pomp} functions as part of a \code{covariate_table}, but this functionality may occasionally be useful.
    \item \code{bspline_eval} is now deprecated as part of the \pkg{pomp} C API.
    \item The formatting of some printed messages has been modified to forestall warnings in the latest R-devel.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.4.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Stateful objective functions (class \sQuote{objfun}) now behave as if they are \sQuote{pomp} objects.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.4.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item C-level functions \code{set_pomp_userdata} and \code{unset_pomp_userdata} are no longer exported.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.3.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{stew} now returns timing information by default.
    \item The spurious warnings associated with NULL \code{userdata} have been eliminated.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.2.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item The new option \code{on_load} allows one to specify a C snippet that will be executed at the time the C snippet library is loaded.
    \item Internally, the \code{userdata} are made available via calls to \code{pompLoad} rather than within each call to a \pkg{pomp} workhorse.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.2.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item The data frames returned by \code{cond_logLik} and \code{eff_sample_size} when \code{format="data.frame"} have been improved.
    In particular, they contain (as variable \code{time}) the times (rather than the index of the time vector as before).
    \item Changes to the report generated by \code{spy}.
    \item Some documentation improvements.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.2.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item The manual pages have been reorganized, with improved cross-linking.
    \item A bug in \code{filter_traj} etc. arising when not all state variables have names was fixed.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.2.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item This version adds the new basic component \code{dinit} for evaluating the probability density function of the initial-state distribution.
    There is a corresponding workhorse function, \code{dinit()}.
    \item The constructor \code{pomp} now takes the optional argument \code{nstatevars}, which can be used to increase the dimension of the latent state-vectors created by \code{rinit}.
    By default, \code{nstatevars = length(statenames)}, and \code{nstatevars} can only be used to \emph{increase}, not to decrease, the dimension of the latent state process.
    Moreover, \code{nstatevars} has no effect if the \code{rinit} basic component is furnished as an \R function.
    \item Name checking on internally-created vectors and arrays is less strict than previously.
    In particular, it is possible to have variables without names (i.e., \code{""}).
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.2.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{reulermultinom} now returns \code{NA} rather than \code{NaN}, in keeping with the behavior of \code{rbinom}.
    Thanks to John Drake for calling attention to this issue.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.1.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug in \code{stew} resulting in namespace conflicts has been repaired.
    \item We no longer import directly from \pkg{tidyverse} functions.
    This reduces the list of packages upon which \pkg{pomp} depends from 20 to 5.
    This does introduce a dependency on the \pkg{data.table} package.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.0.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item When the archive directory does not exist, \code{bake} and \code{stew} now create it.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 5.0.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item We no longer import from \pkg{plyr}.
    \item The \code{dimnames} attributes of various arrays that appear in \pkg{pomp}, including arrays of observables, state variables, parameters, covariates, and so on, have been made uniform.
    In particular, when a dimension of an array corresponds to variables with different names, this dimension is itself named \dQuote{name}.
    Previously, its name was sometimes \dQuote{variable} and sometimes \dQuote{parameter}.
    This change is meant to streamline interaction with the \pkg{tidyverse}.
    \item Some minor bugfixes.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.7.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Functions with names.that.contain.dots that have been deprecated since version 4.5.1 are now defunct.
    Attempts to use such functions will generate an error with a message indicating the replacement function.
    \item \code{plot} now removes \code{NA}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.6.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item Better handling of \sQuote{listie}s (lists of \sQuote{pomp} objects).
    \item New \code{concat} function to turn lists of \sQuote{pomp} objects into \sQuote{listies}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.6.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Bug fix in \code{filter_traj} applied to \sQuote{pfilterList} and \sQuote{pmcmcList} objects.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.6.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{states} and \code{obs} methods take a new optional argument, \code{format}.
    Setting \code{format="data.frame"} causes the method to return the states or data in a convenient data-frame format.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.6.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item When \code{melt} is applied to a list, the identifier variable is now \dQuote{\code{.Lx}}, where \code{x} denotes the level.
    This applies when \code{as.data.frame} is used to coerce a list of \sQuote{pomp} objects, and when \code{saved_states} is used to extract the particles from a list of \sQuote{pfilterd_pomp} objects.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.5.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{logmeanexp} can now compute the effective sample size, which can be useful in determining the reliability of its estimate.
    To do so, set \code{ess=TRUE} in a call to \code{logmeanexp}.
    \item \code{logmeanexp} now returns a fully-named vector when either \code{se=TRUE} or \code{ess=TRUE}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.5.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item A new \code{format} argument has been added to the extractor functions \code{cond_logLik}, \code{eff_sample_size}, \code{filter_mean}, \code{filter_traj}, \code{forecast}, \code{pred_mean}, \code{pred_var}, and \code{saved_states}.
    This allows the user to extract the relevant elements in data-frame format if desired.
    \item \pkg{pomp} no longer depends on the superseded package \pkg{reshape2}.
    The \code{melt} function for converting arrays and nested lists into data frames is accordingly no longer re-exported from \pkg{reshape2}.
    It has been replaced by a stricter version of \code{melt}.

    \item The \pkg{magrittr} pipe \code{\%>\%} is no longer re-exported by \pkg{pomp}: use the native \R pipe \code{|>} instead.
    \item The package now requires \R version 4.1 at least.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.5.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item All \pkg{pomp} functions with names.that.contain.dots have been deprecated in favor of functions in \sQuote{snake_case}.
    This is to avoid anticipated problems with CRAN checks, which (falsely) assume that certain functions with dotted.names are S3 methods.
    From this point, no exported \pkg{pomp} function has such a name.
    \item The \code{dimnames} attributes for some of the arrays computed in \code{pfilter} and \code{pmcmc} computations have changed.
    In particular, whereas in previous versions, the \code{time} dimension was given names that were character strings composed of decimal representations of the time (difficult to work with and prone to roundoff error), the \code{time} dimension now is not given names.
    \item A bug that resulted in \code{gompertz} giving different simulations on Windows machines has been fixed.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.4.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug in trajectory computation for maps (discrete-time dynamical systems) has been fixed.
    Thanks to Felicia Magpantay for noticing it and tracking it down.
    \item Minor documentation improvements.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.4.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The weighted quantile function \code{wquant} now uses the Harrell-Davis estimator instead of the type-7 estimator used previously.
    This eliminates bugs associated with non-integer weights.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.4.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item It is now possible to retrieve the weighted particles computed in the course of a \code{pfilter} computation.
    To accomplish this, set \code{save.states="weighted"} in the call to \code{pfilter} and retrieve the particles and their weights using \code{saved.states}.
    Previously, one could obtain only the unweighted particles.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.4.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Some documentation improvements.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.3.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item The new function \code{wquant} computes weighted quantiles.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.3.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item The precise order in which the \code{pmcmc} function computes prior and likelihood of furnished and proposed parameters has changed slightly.
    This prevents proposals that are incompatible with the prior from being passed to \code{pfilter} and forestalls an associated class of errors.
    A consequence of this change, \code{pmcmc} computations using the new version will differ very slightly from previous computations, even with the RNG seed fixed at its previous values.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.3.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item There is now a \proglang{C} interface to the \code{bspline_eval} function.
    See the \href{https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/C_API.html}{\pkg{pomp} \proglang{C} API documentation} for details.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.3.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{bspline.basis} function now takes the optional argument \code{rg} which allows one to specify the range over which the basis will be constructed.
    By default, this is \code{range(x)}, which agrees with the behavior in earlier versions.
    \item Documentation improvements.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.2.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The archiving functions \code{bake} and \code{stew} now use a slightly less exacting comparison of the expression, \code{expr}, they are furnished.
    \strong{NB:} Running \code{bake} or \code{stew} with archives created by earlier versions may result in recomputation.
    \item The \code{time} method has been extended to \code{pompList} and related objects.
    \item All workhorse functions except \code{partrans} have new default arguments.
    \item Some documentation improvements.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.2.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item The archiving functions \code{bake} and \code{stew} now take the argument \code{dir}, which is the directory holding the archive files.
    By default, this is the current working directory or the value of the global option \code{pomp.archive.dir}.
    \item A new global option, \code{pomp_archive_dir}, can be used to specify the locations of archive files used by \code{bake} and \code{stew}.
    \item Documentation repair of issue flagged by Kurt Hornik (9 June 2022).
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.2.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Minor changes, invisible to the user.
    \item Minor changes to the \proglang{C} codes to keep up with R-devel.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.1.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Minor changes to the \proglang{C} codes to keep up with R-devel.
    \item Minor changes in the implementation of \code{bake} and \code{stew}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.11}{
  \itemize{
    \item Change in the names of the variables returned by \code{as.data.frame} applied to a \sQuote{pfilterd.pomp} object.
    \item Fixed bug found by Jesse Wheeler and Ed Ionides, to do with `simulate()` with `include.data=TRUE`.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.10}{
  \itemize{
    \item It is now possible to plot lists of \sQuote{pomp} and \sQuote{pomp}-derived objects using a single call to \code{plot}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.9}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{rbetabinom} and \code{dbetabinom} functions, long present as part of the \href{https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/C_API.html}{\proglang{C} API}, are now available as \R functions.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.8}{
  \itemize{
    \item The SIR examples \code{sir()} and \code{sir2()} now use a negative binomial measurement model.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.7}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{parmat} can now take a data frame of parameters and convert it into a matrix suitable for furnishing to the \code{params} argument of any \pkg{pomp} function.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.6}{
  \itemize{
    \item It is now possible to change the parameters in an \sQuote{objfun} (objective function) object using \code{coef(object)<-value}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{parmat} now takes an optional argument, \code{names}, which allows the user to name the parameter sets.
    \item Independent realizations of the stochastic processes modeled in \pkg{pomp} are now distinguished by different values of \code{.id}.
    This behavior is now uniform throughout.
    \item \code{bake} and \code{stew} now send messages instead of warnings when they recompute an archive due to a change in code or dependencies.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item The ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (\code{eakf}) has been refactored.
    It now makes use of the \code{emeasure} and \code{vmeasure} basic components to compute an approximation of the linear relationship between the latent state and the observed variables.
    \item The \code{forecast} method now works for \code{pfiterd_pomp} objects (i.e., results of \code{pfilter}, \code{pmcmc}, or \code{mif2} computations).
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Two new basic model components have been introduced.
    These are:
    \describe{
      \item{emeasure,}{which computes the expectation of the observable variables conditional on the latent state;}
      \item{vmeasure,}{which computes the covariance matrix of the observables given the latent state.}
    }
    These are used by the newly refactored ensemble Kalman filter, \code{enkf}.
    \item The basic (linear, Gaussian) Kalman filter is now available as \code{kalmanFilter}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Computation of Monte Carlo-adjusted profile likelihood is now facilitated by the new \code{mcap} function.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item The default return-value format for \code{trajectory} now matches that of \code{simulate}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 4.0.0}{
  Version 4 contains a few changes that are not backward compatible.
  These are all to do with the elementary function \code{trajectory}, which computes trajectories of the deterministic dynamical skeleton.
  See below for details.
  \itemize{
    \item The behavior of \code{trajectory} now fully conforms to the behavior of other \pkg{pomp} elementary functions.
    In particular, one can now add, remove, or modify basic model components in a call to \code{trajectory} just as one can with \code{simulate}, \code{pfilter}, \code{probe}, etc.
    Before version 4, additional arguments to \code{trajectory} (i.e., those passed via \code{...}) were passed on to the ODE integrator in the case of continuous-time deterministic skeletons (i.e., vectorfields) and ignored in the case of discrete-time skeletons (i.e., maps).
    As of version 4, in order to adjust ODE integrator settings it is necessary to use the \code{ode_control} argument of \code{trajectory}.
    This behavior matches that of \code{traj_objfun}.
    \item It is now possible to create a \sQuote{pomp} object from scratch using \code{trajectory}, together with a specification of the rinit and skeleton components.
    Prior to version 4, in order to do so, it was necessary to first create a dummy data set, then call \code{pomp}, and then pass the resulting \sQuote{pomp} object to \code{trajectory}.
    This can now be achieved in one call.
    \item The user now has the option, in a call to \code{trajectory}, to have the results returned as one or \sQuote{pomp} objects.
    In this regard, its behavior matches that of \code{simulate}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.5.6}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{states} and \code{obs} methods now work for lists of \sQuote{pomp} objects (\sQuote{listies}).
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.5.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item The workhorse function \code{flow} now has default arguments.
    \item The stateful objective function created by \code{traj_objfun} has been refactored so that it is independent of \code{trajectory}.
    This change is invisible to the user, but lays the groundwork for future changes in \code{trajectory}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.5.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item Stateful objective functions created by \code{traj_objfun}, \code{nlf_objfun}, \code{probe_objfun}, and \code{spect_objfun} now have default arguments.
    In particular, the default is argument is a zero-length numeric vector.
    Calling such a function with no arguments is valid if and only if the objective function was created with no variables to estimate (empty \code{est}).
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.5.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed bug in \code{rprior} arising with integer-valued return vectors.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.5.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Major improvements to the package manual, including richer cross-linking and better organization.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.5.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item When \code{simulate} is called with \code{format="data.frame"} and \code{include.data=TRUE}, the interpolated covariates are now included in the data frame that is returned.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.4.6}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{bake} takes a new option, \code{timing}, that controls whether information on the timing is returned or merely stored.
    By default, this is set to \code{TRUE}, though this default behavior may change in future.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.4.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item When they encounter an archive produced by an older version, \code{bake} and \code{stew} now update the archive in the new format.
    Recomputation should never be triggered in this case:
    If recomputation is desired, delete the archive file.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.4.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{bake} and \code{stew} now archive a digest of the code in \code{expr} and on subsequent calls check to see if the archived version matches the current version.
    Thus, changes to the code automatically trigger recomputation.
    \item \code{bake} and \code{stew} take the new argument \code{dependson}.
    Using this argument, the user can specify objects upon which the computation depends.
    These should be passed as unquoted variables;
    if there are multiple dependencies, they can be passed using \code{c} or \code{list}.
    Digests of these objects will be archived and checked against current values on subsequent calls.
    Thus, changing any dependency will automatically trigger recomputation.
    \item \code{bake} now archives the information pertinent to the \code{bake} call;
    this information is no longer returned along with the result of the computation (unless \code{info=TRUE}).
    Similarly, \code{stew} stores a list, \dQuote{.ingredients}, in the file it creates.
    In the \code{stew} case, unlike all the other objects that are created by \code{expr}, this list is \emph{not} by default loaded into the calling environment (e.g., the user's workspace).
    It will be loaded if the \code{info} flag is set to \code{TRUE}.
    \item \code{freeze} no longer stores the details of the RNG seed and kind as an attribute of the returned object.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.4.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fix bug in \code{bsmc2} arising when some particles have zero likelihood.
    This is Issue #152.
    Thanks to Hola-Kwame Adrakey for reporting it.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.4.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item It is now possible to call \code{partrans} directly on an objective function, such as those created by \code{traj_objfun}, \code{nlf_objfun}, \code{probe_objfun}, or \code{spect_objfun}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.3.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item The package manual and help pages has been streamlined.
    \item The \code{mif2} diagnostic plots have been made more flexible.
    \item Some deprecated functions have been removed.
    These include \code{cond.loglik}, \code{sliceDesign}, \code{runifDesign}, \code{sobolDesign}, and \code{profileDesign}, which have been replaced by \code{code.logLik}, \code{slice_design}, \code{runif_design}, \code{sobol_design}, and \code{profile_design}, respectively.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.3.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug in \code{rgammawn} has been fixed.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.2.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \pkg{pomp} \proglang{C} API has been expanded a bit, to facilitate other packages' linking to the \pkg{pomp} library.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.1.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item The help pages have been improved, with an description of the overall package structure and pages on basic model components, elementary algorithms, and estimation algorithms.
    \item A note to Windows users on avoiding certain \proglang{C} snippet compilation errors has been added to the help pages.
    \item The behavior of \code{profile_design} has changed.
    Previously, the same random (or sub-random) sequence was used for all non-profile parameters.
    Now, for each profile slice, a distinct set of points is generated.
    \item \code{profileDesign}, \code{sliceDesign}, \code{runifDesign}, and \code{sobolDesign} have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    They are replaced by \code{profile_design}, \code{slice_design}, \code{runif_design}, and \code{sobol_design}, respectively.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.0.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item A new \code{saved.states} method allows one to extract the saved states from a particle filter computation.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.0.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item All instances of \code{cond.loglik} have been changed to \code{cond.logLik}, to remove a common source of typographical error.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.0.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item A new sequential importance sampling algorithm has been implemented as \code{wpfilter}.
    This is a generalization of the algorithm in \code{pfilter} in that it tracks the weights of the particles and allows the user to customize the resampling scheme.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 3.0.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item In \code{mif2}, the specification of particle numbers, \code{Np}, has changed.
    When \code{Np} is supplied as a function, \code{Np(0)} is the requested number of particles at the beginning of the time series.
    The previous behavior was that \code{Np(1)} specified the requested number of particles.
    This behavior now matches that of the other particle filtering algorithms, \code{pfilter}, \code{bsmc2}, and \code{pmcmc}.
    \item \code{bsmc2} can now accept a variable number of particles, as do the other particle-filter based algorithms \code{pfilter}, \code{pmcmc}, and \code{mif2}.

    Previously, these were always equal to the number of weights supplied.

    See the \href{https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/blog.html}{\pkg{pomp} news blog} (\url{https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/blog.html}) for more information.
    \item The long-deprecated functions \code{onestep.dens}, \code{onestep.sim}, \code{discrete.time.sim}, \code{euler.sim}, \code{gillespie.sim}, \code{gillespie.hl.sim}, \code{conv.rec}, and \code{values}  have been removed.
    These have been replaced as follows

\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 2.0.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{zeronames} argument has been renamed \code{accumvars}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 2.0.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item In the course of ordinary work, one should never need to interact with the low-level \code{pomp} constructor function now.
    \item The \code{pompExample} function has been dropped.
    The various examples are now included as regular functions that construct \sQuote{pomp} objects.
    \item The \code{bbs} example has been dropped.
    \item One can now modify basic model components at (almost) any stage in a pipeline of \pkg{pomp} computations.
    All the top-level inference functions, plus \code{probe}, \code{pfilter}, and \code{simulate} now allow modification of basic model components.
    \item The \code{rprocess} plugins \code{onestep.sim}, \code{discrete.time.sim}, \code{euler.sim}, \code{gillespie.sim}, and \code{gillespie.hl.sim} have been renamed \code{onestep}, \code{discrete_time}, \code{euler}, \code{gillespie}, and \code{gillespie_hl}, respectively.
    The old usage is available but deprecated.
    \item One can now call \code{simulate} on a model without reference to any data.
    \item The covariate table facility (\code{covariate_table}) now supports piecewise constant interpolation.
    \item The syntax with which one includes covariates via \code{covariate_table} has become more flexible.
    Specifically, the arguments to \code{covariate_table} are now evaluated sequentially, so that later ones can depend on earlier ones.
    Once evaluated, the covariates are bound column-wise into a single data frame.
    \item The manner in which one writes \R functions to specify basic model components has been totally changed.
    Before, one wrote functions that took specific arguments such as 'x', 'params', and 'covars'.
    Now, one writes such functions with any or all state variables, observables, covariates, and/or time as arguments.
    \item \code{simulate} now returns more informative results when simulations from multiple parameter sets are simultaneously computed.
    Specifically, if \code{params} has column names, these are used to identify the resulting simulations.
    Thus when \code{format = "pomps"} (the default), the names of the resulting list will be constructed from the column names of \code{params}.
    Likewise, when \code{format = "arrays"}, the resulting arrays will have informative column names;
    When \code{format = "data.frame"}, the identifier variable will make use of the column names.
    \item The basic particle filter, \code{pfilter}, has a simpler mode of operation:
    \code{params} should be a single parameter set only.
    That is, it is no longer possible to pass a matrix of parameters to \code{pfilter}.
    \item The Liu-West algorithm, \code{bsmc2}, has a simpler mode of operation:
    \code{params} should be a single parameter set only:
    the SMC particles are drawn from \code{rprior}.
    \item The \code{as.data.frame}, \code{states}, and \code{obs} options for \code{simulate} have been done away with.
    One now chooses the format of the returned simulations via the \code{format} argument.
    When one simulates at multiple parameter sets, list names, array \code{dimnames}, or identifying variables in the output data frame help to correlate simulations with parameter sets.
    \item The \code{as.data.frame} argument to \code{trajectory} has been removed in favor of a new \code{format} argument that allows one to choose between receiving the results in the form of an \code{"array"} or a \code{"data.frame"}.
    \item All the basic model components now have defaults.
    \itemize{
      \item The default \code{rinit} behavior remains as it was:
      it assumes the initial state distribution is concentrated at a point mass determined by parameters with \dQuote{\code{.0}} or \dQuote{\code{_0}} suffices.

      \item The default process model is \dQuote{missing}: calls to \code{dprocess} and \code{rprocess} will result in missing values (\code{NA}).
      \item The default measurement model is \dQuote{missing} as well.
      \item The default prior is flat and improper:
      all calls to the default \code{dprior} result in \code{1} (\code{0} if \code{log = TRUE}, and all calls to \code{rprior} result in \code{NA}.
      \item The default skeleton is missing.
      \item The default parameter transformations remain the identity.
    }
    \item The \code{transform} argument present in many \pkg{pomp} algorithms has been removed.
    Parameter transformations are now automatically performed when appropriate.
    The default parameter transformation remains the identity.
    \item The old \code{probe.match} and \code{traj.match} functions have been removed.
    The new approach to parameter estimation based on numerical optimization involves constructing stateful objective functions.
    There are now three of these: \code{traj.match.objfun}, \code{probe.match.objfun}, and \code{spect.match.objfun}.
    \item The documentation system has been thoroughly overhauled.
    \item In \code{skeleton}, the \code{t} argument has been replaced by \code{times}, to make this uniform with the other workhorse functions.
    \item Covariates are now included using the \code{covariate_table} construction, passed via the \code{covar} argument to \code{pomp}.
    The \code{tcovar} argument is no longer used.
    \item Instead of providing separate \code{fromEstimationScale} and \code{toEstimationScale} arguments to \code{pomp}, one now provides a single \code{partrans} argument constructed by means of the new function \code{parameter_trans}.
    In addition, references to \dQuote{fromEstimationScale} and \dQuote{toEstimationScale} have been abbreviated to \dQuote{fromEst} and \dQuote{toEst}, respectively, throughout the package.
    \item When writing \proglang{C} snippets for parameter transformations, the notation \code{T_p} refers to the value of \code{p} on the estimation scale.
    Thus, if parameter \eqn{alpha} is to be log-transformed for estimation, the \code{toEst} snippet would contain the line \code{T_alpha = log(alpha);} and the \code{fromEst} snippet would include \code{alpha = exp(T_alpha);}.
    \item The \code{parameter_trans} function now takes optional arguments \code{log}, \code{logit}, and \code{barycentric}, with names of parameters to be log-, logit-, and log-barycentric transformed, respectively.
    \item The \code{measurement.model} argument to \code{pomp} has been removed.
    It is now necessary to specify the measurement model directly using \code{rmeasure} and/or \code{dmeasure}.
    \item The \code{initializer} is no longer referred to by that name.
    It is now \code{rinit}, since it draws from the distribution of the latent state at the initial time.
    The low-level function \code{init.state} has been replaced by \code{rinit}.
    \item The \code{conv.rec} method has been deprecated, replaced by the new \code{traces} method.
    \item The \code{euler.sir} example has been renamed \code{sir}.
    \item The \code{gillespie.sir} example has been renamed \code{sir2}.
    \item The \code{covmat} method can now be applied to a \code{probed.pomp} object.
    It returns the estimated covariance matrix of the probes.
    \item When \code{trajectory} calls on \pkg{deSolve} routines to numerically integrate a model vectorfield, more informative error messages are generated, and diagnostics are printed when \code{verbose = TRUE}.
    \item The \code{show} method applied to pomp objects is now quite terse.
    To obtain detailed information, the \code{spy} method is available.
    \item The \code{spy} method now returns the information formerly displayed in a call to \code{show}, in addition to the \proglang{C} files associated with any \proglang{C} snippets.
    \item The use of \code{$} methods to access the slots of \pkg{pomp} S4 objects has now been removed.
    These classes are no longer exported (for the most part).
    \item The \code{transform} argument to the \code{probe.quantile} function has been removed (as it is entirely redundant!).
    \item The old and deprecated \code{mif} and \code{bsmc} methods have been removed.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.18.8}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{obs} and \code{states} arguments of \code{simulate} are deprecated and will be removed in a forthcoming release.

    \item A new \file{pomp_defines.h} header is provided for developers of packages that depend on \pkg{pomp}.
    \item Internally, \code{rprocess} is no longer stored as an \R function.
    The use of plugins is now required for the implementation of the \code{rprocess} component.
    Currently, there are five plugins available:
    \code{onestep.sim}, \code{discrete.time.sim}, \code{euler.sim}, \code{gillespie.sim}, and \code{gillespie.hl.sim}.
    \item The new \code{hitch} function automates the building and linking of \proglang{C} snippets and \R functions into \code{pomp.fun}s.
    \item The handling of \code{dprocess} has changed.
    The \code{onestep.dens} plugin is now deprecated and will soon be removed.
    \code{dprocess} is now specified directly using either a \proglang{C} snippet or an \R function, in much the same way that, for example, \code{dmeasure} is specified.
    \item The old \sQuote{forward} and \sQuote{inverse} options for the \code{dir} argument of \code{partrans} have been dispensed with.

  \itemize{
    \item A new \code{dmultinom} function is provided in \sQuote{pomp.h}.
    This provides the probability distribution function for the multinomial distribution.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.14.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Improved tests.
    \item Fixed bugs emerging in R-devel due to refactoring of underlying \R source code.

\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.13.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item Eamon O'Dea pointed out that the bug in \code{gillespie.sim}, addressed by version 1.12.3, was not completely fixed.
    This problem has now been resolved.
    In addition, covariates are now guaranteed to be evaluated at least once per observation interval.
    \item The new argument \code{hmax} to \code{gillespie.sim} allows the user to specify the maximum step size that will be taken before covariates are evaluated.
    \item The K-leap method has been removed.
    Its accuracy is low on test problems and it is difficult to make it compatible with the pomp paradigm.
    In particular, it does not readily accomodate time-varying covariates in a sensible way, nor does it lend itself to simulations at pre-specified times.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.13.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{bspline.basis} and \code{periodic.bspline.basis} now take an optional non-negative integer argument \code{deriv}.
    When \code{deriv > 0}, the order-\code{deriv} derivative of each basis function is returned.
    \item A new function, \code{periodic_bspline_basis_eval_deriv}, has been added to the \proglang{C} API.
    This function gives access, at the \proglang{C} level, to evaluation of the derivatives of periodic B-splines.

\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.12.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The Ricker example has a new parameter, \eqn{c}, which scales the (unobserved) population size.
    By default, \eqn{c=1}, so that the behavior is as before.

  \itemize{
    \item Improved error trapping.

}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.11.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Some changes have been made to the use of random numbers in some codes (the stochastic simulations in \code{gillespie.sim} and the resampling in the particle-filtering codes).
    These changes will mean that calculations performed before will not be reproducible in perfect detail, but will be statistically equivalent.
    \item Minor changes in \proglang{C} codes to obviate warnings generated by T. Kalibera's \code{rchk} checks.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.11.2}{
  \itemize{

  \itemize{
    \item The functions \code{bake}, \code{stew}, and \code{freeze} now preserve information about the system time used in computation as an attribute of the returned object.
    In addition, these functions store information about the RNG settings.
    \item Some documentation improvements, courtesy of Sebastian Funk.

}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.9.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The deprecated options to supply a matrix or numeric vector as the \code{data} argument to \code{pomp} have been removed and doing so now generates an error.
    The first argument to \code{pomp}, \code{data}, must now be provided either as a data frame or as an object of class \code{pomp}.
    See \code{?pomp} for details.
    \item The deprecated \code{skeleton.type} and \code{skelmap.delta.t} arguments to \code{pomp} have been removed.
    Using these arguments will now generate an error message.
    The correct method of specifying the deterministic skeleton is now explained in the help pages (\code{?pomp}).

    \item Improved test suite.
    \item Minor documentation correction.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.8.11}{
  \itemize{
    \item During particle filtering, when non-finite \code{dmeasure} values are generated, an error is generated and the offending parameters, states, data, and time are reported.
    In methods that use parameter transformations (\code{transform=TRUE}), the reported parameters were on the transformed (estimation) scale, which can be confusing.
    The error message now gives the parameters on the natural (model) scale.
    \item Modified \file{src/ssa.c} to fix UBSAN errors.

    \item A bug in \code{mif2} arising when filtering fails in the final timestep has been fixed.
    In this case, when all particles are deemed inconsistent with the data, we use an unweighted mean (with a warning) in place of the default weighted mean.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.7.7}{
  \itemize{
    \item The stochastic simulation algorithms underlying the Gillespie and K-leap methods (\code{gillespie.sim}, \code{kleap.sim}) have been refactored in C.
    In addition, errors due to accumulation of round-off error have been repaired.
    The result will be more accurate, but somewhat slower when there are a very large number of reactions.
    \item Further improvements to the test suite.
    Code coverage is now 100\%.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.7.6}{

  \itemize{
    \item The generation of Sobol' sequences (\code{sobolDesign}, \code{profileDesign}) is now performed using the \pkg{NLopt} routines written in \proglang{C} instead of the original \acronym{TOMS} 659 \proglang{FORTRAN} codes.
