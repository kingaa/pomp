_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _2._0._0:

        • Covariates are now included using the ‘covariate_table’
          construction, passed via the ‘covar’ argument to ‘pomp’.  The
          ‘tcovar’ argument is no longer used.

        • Instead of providing separate ‘fromEstimationScale’ and
          ‘toEstimationScale’ arguments to ‘pomp’, one now provides a
          single ‘partrans’ argument constructed by means of the new
          function ‘parameter_trans’.  In addition, references to
          “fromEstimationScale” and “toEstimationScale” have been
          abbreviated to “fromEst” and “toEst”, respectively,
          throughout the package.

        • When writing C snippets for parameter transformations, the
          notation ‘T_p’ refers to the value of ‘p’ on the estimation
          scale.  Thus, if parameter alpha is to be log-transformed for
          estimation, the ‘toEst’ snippet would contain the line
          ‘T_alpha = log(alpha);’ and the ‘fromEst’ snippet would
          include ‘alpha = exp(T_alpha);’.

        • The ‘parameter_trans’ function now takes arguments ‘log’,
          ‘logit’, and ‘barycentric’, with names of parameters to be
          log-, logit-, and log-barycentric transformed, respectively.

        • The ‘measurement.model’ argument to ‘pomp’ has been removed.
          It is now necessary to specify the measurement model directly
          using ‘rmeasure’ and/or ‘dmeasure’.

        • The ‘initializer’ is no longer referred to by that name.  It
          is now ‘rinit’, since it draws from the distribution of the
          latent state at the initial time.  The low-level function
          ‘init.state’ has been replaced by ‘rinit’.

        • ‘values’ has been deprecated and replaced by ‘probevals’.

        • The ‘conv.rec’ method has been deprecated, replaced by the
          new ‘traces’ method.

        • The ‘euler.sir’ example has been renamed ‘sir’.

        • The ‘gillespie.sir’ example has been renamed ‘sir2’.

        • The ‘covmat’ method can now be applied to a ‘probed.pomp’
          object.  It returns the estimated covariance matrix of the
          probes.

        • When ‘trajectory’ calls on ‘deSolve’ routines to numerically
          integrate a model vectorfield, more informative error
          messages are generated, and diagnostics are printed when
          ‘verbose = TRUE’.

        • The ‘show’ method applied to pomp objects is now quite terse.
          To obtain detailed information, the ‘spy’ method is
          available.

        • The ‘spy’ method now returns the information formerly
          displayed in a call to ‘show’, in addition to the C files
          associated with any C snippets.

        • The use of ‘$’ methods to access the slots of ‘pomp’ S4
          objects has now been removed.  These classes are no longer
          exported (for the most part).

        • The ‘transform’ argument to the ‘probe.quantile’ function has
          been removed (as it is entirely redundant!).

        • The old and deprecated ‘mif’ and ‘bsmc’ methods have been
          removed.

        • One can now directly create a pomp by calling ‘simulate’,
          specifying ‘rprocess’ and, optionally, ‘rmeasure’, without
          having to first create a dummy data frame.

        • A bug in ‘pfilter’ (and hence ‘pmcmc’) when
          ‘filter.traj=TRUE’ was discovered and fixed.  In the buggy
          version, the filter trajectory was sampled with incorrect
          weights.

        • Timo Voipio contributed a pull request that traps the error
          resulting from ‘sannbox’ being passed a ‘candidate.dist’ that
          is not a function.

        • ‘show’ and ‘print’ methods have been made very terse: they
          simply report on the class of the object in question.  To see
          more detailed information about a ‘pomp’ object, use ‘spy’.

        • New (unexported) ‘solibs<-’ method allows developers of
          packages extending ‘pomp’ to incorporate C snippets into
          object that contain ‘pomp’ objects.

        • New ‘verbose’ option in ‘trajectory’ gives diagnostic
          information from ‘deSolve’ integration routines.  Of course,
          this is pertinent only if the model skeleton is a
          vectorfield.

        • Bug in the display of ‘istate’ when ‘deSolve::ode’ errors has
          been fixed.

        • New ‘hitch’ function facilitates construction of ‘pomp.fun’
          objects from R functions, C snippets, and links to external
          libraries.

        • Native routines needed to access ‘pomp.fun’ objects in C are
          now registered for use by other packages.

        • ‘coef(object) <- NULL’, where ‘object’ is of class ‘pomp’,
          erases any parameters stored in ‘object’.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _1._1_8._3:

        • The ‘euler.sir’, ‘gillespie.sir’, ‘blowflies’, ‘ricker’,
          ‘bbs’, ‘dacca’, and ‘rw2’ examples are all now implemented
          using C snippets.

        • A new ‘pomp_defines.h’ header is provided for developers of
          packages that depend on ‘pomp’.

        • Internally, ‘rprocess’ is no longer stored as an R function.
          The use of plugins is now required for the implementation of
          the ‘rprocess’ component.  Currently, there are five plugins
          available: ‘onestep.sim’, ‘discrete.time.sim’, ‘euler.sim’,
          ‘gillespie.sim’, and ‘gillespie.hl.sim’.

        • The new ‘hitch’ function automates the building and linking
          of C snippets and R functions into ‘pomp.fun’s.

        • The handling of ‘dprocess’ has changed.  The ‘onestep.dens’
          plugin is now deprecated and will soon be removed.
          ‘dprocess’ is now specified directly using either a C snippet
          or an R function, in much the same way that, for example,
          ‘dmeasure’ is specified.

        • The old ‘forward’ and ‘inverse’ options for the ‘dir’
          argument of ‘partrans’ have been dispensed with.  The much
          more descriptive options ‘toEstimationScale’ and
          ‘fromEstimationScale’ remain.

        • When altering parameters in a call to ‘probe’ on a
          ‘probed.pomp’ object, the new parameters were ignored.  This
          bug has been fixed.

        • ‘mif2’, ‘pfilter’, ‘probe’, ‘probe.match’, and
          ‘probe.match.objfun’ can now gracefully handle a list in the
          ‘start’ or ‘params’ arguments.

        • New ‘spy’ method displays the C snippet file(s) associated
          with a ‘pomp’ object.

        • Messages from the compiler resulting from attempts to compile
          C snippets are now suppressed on all platforms except in case
          of failure.  Setting ‘verbose=TRUE’ forces display of these
          messages.

        • Source codes have been revisited to obviate warnings
          generated by T. Kalibera's latest ‘rchk’ checks.

        • Fix a minor bugs in ‘spect’.

        • Improve test coverage.

        • ‘spect.match’ has been refactored, with small changes to the
          interface.

        • ‘pomp’ now handles specification of workhorse functions
          (i.e., ‘rprocess’, ‘dprocess’, ‘rmeasure’, ‘dmeasure’,
          ‘initializer’, ‘skeleton’, ‘rprior’, ‘dprior’,
          ‘fromEstimationScale’, ‘toEstimationScale’) as ‘NULL’ more

        • Fix bug in ‘conv.rec’ when only one parameter is requested.

        • Correct and improve documentation for ‘conv.rec’.

        • ‘coef<-’ can now take a list of parameters: it simply applies
          ‘unlist’ to turn the list into a numeric vector.

        • Simplify ‘conv.rec’.

        • Issue #56, in which covariate names are discarded when
          coercing a pomp object to a data frame, has been fixed.
          Thanks to Eamon O'Dea for reporting this bug.

        • More informative error messages are given when ‘bake’ or
          ‘freeze’ return ‘NULL’.  In such a case, these functions now
          generate a warning and return a character-string message,
          with attributes.

        • Improve documentation of ‘traj.match’, in response to Issue
          #57.

        • The old facility for Gillespie simulations, ‘gillespie.sim’,

        • The old ‘skeleton.type’ and ‘skelmap.delta.t’ arguments of
          the ‘pomp’ constructor, which have generated error messages
          since version 1.9.2, have been done away with completely.

        • Eamon O'Dea pointed out that the bug in ‘gillespie.sim’,
          addressed by version 1.12.3, was not completely fixed.  This
          problem has now been resolved.  In addition, covariates are
          now guaranteed to be evaluated at least once per observation
          interval.

        • The new argument ‘hmax’ to ‘gillespie.sim’ allows the user to
          specify the maximum step size that will be taken before
          covariates are evaluated.

        • The K-leap method has been removed.  Its accuracy is low on
          test problems and it is difficult to make it compatible with
          the pomp paradigm.  In particular, it does not readily
          accomodate time-varying covariates in a sensible way, nor
          does it lend itself to simulations at pre-specified times.

          returned.

        • A new function, ‘periodic_bspline_basis_eval_deriv’, has been
          added to the C API.  This function gives access, at the C

          object of class ‘pomp’.  See ‘?pomp’ for details.

        • The deprecated ‘skeleton.type’ and ‘skelmap.delta.t’
          arguments to ‘pomp’ have been removed.  Using these arguments
          will now generate an error message.  The correct method of
          specifying the deterministic skeleton is now explained in the
          help pages (‘?pomp’).

        • During particle filtering, when non-finite ‘dmeasure’ values
          are generated, an error is generated and the offending
          parameters, states, data, and time are reported.  In methods
          that use parameter transformations (‘transform=TRUE’), the
          reported parameters were on the transformed (estimation)
          scale, which can be confusing.  The error message now gives
          the parameters on the natural (model) scale.

        • Modified ‘src/ssa.c’ to fix UBSAN errors.

        • A bug in ‘mif2’ arising when filtering fails in the final

        • The redundant ‘pars’ argument to ‘mif’ has been removed.
          Names of parameters to be estimated are taken from the
