        • There is a new, adaptive MCMC proposal function,
          ‘mvn.rw.adaptive’ that can be used in ‘pmcmc’.

        • The new ‘covmat’ method, applied to ‘abc’, ‘abcList’,
          ‘pmcmc’, or ‘pmcmcList’ objects, returns an inflated
          empirical covariance matrix suitable for use as input to the
          proposal generator ‘mvn.rw’.

        • The deprecated ‘pars’ and ‘rw.sd’ arguments from ‘abc’ and

        • The default value of ‘max.fail’ for ‘pmcmc’ is now ‘Inf’.
          That is, by default ‘pmcmc’ will not halt (but will issue a
          warning) when filtering failure occurs (i.e., no particles
          are consistent with the data, as defined by the likelihood
          threshold ‘tol’).

        • ‘logmeanexp’ has used a delta-method estimate of the variance
          in log(mean(exp(x))) when ‘se = TRUE’.  This gave
          misleadingly small values when the variance in exp(x) was
          large.  The new ‘logmeanexp’ uses a jackknife estimate of the
          variance.  This is still conservative, in that it is biased
          upwards, but is more robust.

        • ‘pomp’ now includes ‘magrittr’, ‘plyr’, ‘reshape2’,
          ‘ggplot2’, and ‘knitr’ in its ‘Suggests’ field: these
          packages are available for use in ‘pompExample’s and package
          tests.

        • There is now a ‘coef’ method for ‘mifList’ and ‘mif2List’
          objects.

        • By default, when ‘Csnippet’s are used, the source code is now
          stored internally to the ‘pomp’ object.  When a ‘pomp’ object
          is used, a test is first performed to see if the needed
          shared-object file exists.  If it does not, the source code
          is written to a file in the session's temporary directory,
          which is then compiled and loaded.  This feature allows
          ‘pomp’ objects to be stored and reused across R sessions.
          The name of the file is constructed using a hash of the
          file's contents.

        • The functions ‘bake’ and ‘stew’ have arguments that allow the
          control of the RNG.  These functions can now set the state
          (and kind) of the RNG and restore it when they return.

        • The new function ‘freeze’ allows control of the RNG
          similarly.

        • The ‘seed’ argument of ‘bsmc’ and ‘bsmc2’ has been removed.
          Its use now generates a warning, stating that it has no
          effect.

        • The ‘seed’ argument to ‘pfilter’ is now deprecated and will
          be removed soon.  Equivalent functionality is provided via

        • The new functions ‘bake’ and ‘stew’ faciliate storing

        • ‘pompBuilder’, which has not been actively maintained for
          time due to the fact that its facilities are all provided by
          ‘pomp’ via ‘Csnippet’s, is now no longer exported.

        • ‘pmcmc’ and ‘pfilter’ now have the capability of saving
          filtered trajectories.  These can be extracted using the new
          method ‘filter.traj’.  The principal use will be in
          conjunction with ‘pmcmc’, where, upon convergence to the
          posterior, samples from the filtered trajectories are draws
          from the posterior P[x[1:T] | y[1:T]].  Thanks to Sebastian

        • When using ‘Csnippet’s, by default, the C codes and
          shared-object files are stored in the R session's temporary

        • A full-featured version of IF2, an improved iterated
          filtering algorithm, is now available as ‘mif2’.  This allows
          a more general structure for the random perturbations applied
          to parameters and is generally more efficient and stable than
          IF1.

        • In the ‘pomp’ constructor, unrecognized arguments are stored
          internally for use with user-supplied model functions.  As of
          this version, an informative message is generated when this
          happens.  Previously, this silent behavior was a source of

        • The unfortunately named ‘pomp’ arguments
          ‘parameter.transform’ and ‘parameter.inv.transform’ have been
          deprecated in favor of the more mnemonic ‘toEstimationScale’
          and ‘fromEstimationScale’.  Using the old arguments will
          result in the same behavior as previously, but a warning will

        • The ‘mif’ option ‘cooling.fraction’ has been replaced by the

        • The optimization packages ‘nloptr’ and ‘subplex’ are no

        • ‘mif’ now has the default value ‘var.factor=1’.  Since
          ‘var.factor’ has long been a required parameter, this change

        • When using ‘Csnippet’s or ‘pompBuilder’, it is no longer
          necessary to manually load and unload the dynamically
          loadable library.  This is now handled automatically.
          Accordingly, the ‘link’ argument of ‘pompBuilder’ has been
          removed.  The ‘pompLoad’ and ‘pompUnload’ functions
          introduced in 0.58-1 remain available, though they should

        • ‘pmcmc’ and ‘abc’ can now use arbitrary symmetric proposal
          distributions via the ‘proposal’ argument.  For the moment,
          these are constrained to be symmetric.  Two new functions,
          ‘mvn.diag.rw’ and ‘mvn.rw’ generate suitable proposal
          functions.  The first generates a multivariate normal
          random-walk proposal with diagonal variance-covariance
          matrix; this duplicates the old behavior of both ‘abc’ and
          ‘pmcmc’.  The second, ‘mvn.rw’, corresponds to a multivariate
          normal random-walk proposal with arbitrary
          variance-covariance matrix.

        • In ‘pmcmc’ and ‘abc’, the arguments ‘pars’ and ‘rw.sd’ are
          now unneeded and have been deprecated.  Use of ‘rw.sd’ will
          generate a warning and result in behavior equivalent to
          choosing ‘proposal=mvn.diag.rw(rw.sd)’.  Use of ‘pars’ will
          be ignored, with a warning.

        • In ‘nlf’, the ‘transform.params’ argument is now deprecated;
          use instead the ‘transform’ argument, as in the other
          inference methods.

        • ‘pomp’ now depends on ‘nloptr’, which provides a suite of
          optimization algorithms.  This package can now be used in
          various methods for optimization of an objective function.

        • New inline C functions ‘to_log_barycentric’ and
          ‘from_log_barycentric’ are provided in ‘pomp.h’ to facilitate
          log-barycentric transformations.  These have proven very
          useful in dealing with parameters constrained to sum to one
          (e.g., initial conditions of compartmental models).

        • Bug fix in ‘periodic.bspline.basis’.

        • Package vignettes are no longer available via ‘vignette()’
          but can be reached from the help index.

        • Create new ‘dprior’ and ‘rprior’ slots for ‘pomp’ objects.
          These will be used by the Bayesian methods (currently ‘abc’,

          methods has been removed; hyperparameters are now treated
          just as any others.

        • ‘bsmc’ can now be called so that the particles are drawn from
          the prior distribution (as set by the ‘rprior’ slot).

          variable is set.

        • changes in the way ‘reulermultinom’, ‘deulermultinom’,
          ‘dot_product’ are exported to other packages.  Rather than

        • New ‘"mif2"’ option for ‘mif’.

        • The default behavior for ‘mif’ and ‘pfilter’ with respect to
          filtering failures has been changed.  Before, the default
          behavior has been to stop with an error on the first
          filtering failure (‘max.fail=0’).  Now, the default is
          ‘max.fail=Inf’, i.e., an error is never triggered.

        • The implementation of MIF cooling schedules has been changed
          to make it more general.  The cooling schedule is now
          specified by a ‘type’ and a ‘fraction’.  Currently, supported
          ‘cooling.type’s include ‘geometric’ (the old behavior) and
          ‘hyperbolic’, i.e., a 1/(1+n) schedule.  The
          ‘cooling.fraction’ argument specifies the cooling at 50
          iterations.  That is, if ‘s’ is the intensity of the
          random-walk perturbation to parameters at the first iteration
          (‘rw.sd’), then the intensity at iteration 50 is
          ‘s*cooling.fraction’.

        • Remove all ‘data()’-loadable ‘pomp’ objects.  To load the
          prebuilt example ‘pomp’ objects from previous versions, use
          the new ‘pompExample’ function.  E.g., instead of
          ‘data(euler.sir)’, do ‘pompExample("euler.sir")’.

        • Add native parameter transformation routines to the demos.

        • Change the warning behavior in ‘lookup_table’ so that
          warnings are not generated unless true extrapolation is
          performed (i.e., eliminate the warnings at the boundary).

        • Some small modifications to the ‘pomp.h’ header file.

        • When ‘trajectory’ calls ‘ode’, there is a need to preserve

          way.

        • An EXPERIMENTAL facility for constructing ‘pomp’ objects out
          of native C routines is now included (pompBuilder).  This
          facility is being actively developed and future changes may
          not be backward compatible.

        • A new facility allowing access to the ‘userdata’ slot of a
          ‘pomp’ object from compiled ‘rprocess’, ‘rmeasure’,
          ‘dprocess’, ‘dmeasure’, ‘skeleton’, and ‘partrans’ codes is
          now available.  Calls to the new C routines
          ‘get_pomp_userdata’, ‘get_pomp_userdata_int’, and
          ‘get_pomp_userdata_double’ allow retrieval of these elements.

        • Some of the ‘data()’-loadable examples have been reworked to
          make use of the above facility.  The parameterization of
          these examples has changed.  These changes are not backward
          compatible: codes that depend on the ‘data()’-loadable
          examples may be broken.

        • The ‘gompertz’ example parameter transformations have been
          changed.  No longer are the names of the parameter vector
          changed in the transformation.  This change is not
          backward-compatible, but only codes using this example are
          affected.

        • The ‘euler.sir’ and ‘gillespie.sir’ examples have been
          changed.  The transmission rate beta(t) is now the arithmetic
          sum of the seasonality basis functions.  Before, it was the
          geometric sum.  R_0 is now given by the arithmetic average of
          the beta parameters divided by gamma+mu.  This change is not
          backward-compatible, but only codes using these examples are
          affected.

        • The ‘blowflies’, ‘euler.sir’, ‘gillespie.sir’, ‘bbs’, and
          ‘ricker’ ‘data()’-loadable examples have been changed to make
          the parameterization simpler and more natural.  This change
          is not backward-compatible, but only codes using this example
          are affected.

        • In ‘trajectory’, all vectorfield and map evaluation is now
          done in C for speed.  For continuous-time dynamical systems,
          this gives an approximately 4-fold speedup.

        • Demos have been created to show some examples.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._4_1-_2:

        • A segfault bug in ‘bbs’ example has been fixed.

        • The posterior medians (not means) are now stored in the
          ‘params’ slot of the ‘bsmcd.pomp’ object.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._4_1-_1:

        • New arguments in ‘mif’, ‘nlf’, ‘bsmc’, ‘pmcmc’,
          ‘probe-match’, and ‘traj-match’ allow the estimation to be
          done on a transformed parameter space.  When ‘transform=TRUE’
          in these commands (‘transform.params=TRUE’ for ‘nlf’),
          estimation is performed on the transformed parameter space.
          This is described and demonstrated in the “intro_to_pomp”
          vignette.

        • The ‘data()’-loadable examples have been re-implemented to
          make use of the above-mentioned facility.  Note that this new
          functionality makes it unnecessary to un-transform model
          parameters within the user-specified ‘rprocess’, ‘dprocess’,
          ‘rmeasure’, ‘dmeasure’, ‘skeleton’, and ‘initializer’ codes.
          This change is not backward-compatible, but only codes using
          these ‘data()’-loadable example are affected.

        • The Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo command ‘bsmc’ now
          returns not a list but an object of class ‘bsmcd.pomp’.  An
          experimental ‘plot’ method for objects of this class now
          exists.  Also, the parameter posterior means are now stored
          in the ‘params’ slot of the ‘bsmcd.pomp’ object: access them
          with the ‘coef’ command as usual.

        • A new example, using data from an influenza outbreak in a
          British boarding school and an SIR model, has been included.
          Do ‘data(bbs)’ to load it.

        • Setting the new argument ‘as.data.frame’ to ‘TRUE’ in
          ‘simulate’ and ‘trajectory’ causes the results to be returned
          as a data-frame.

        • A new method ‘partrans’ allows transformation of vectors or
          matrices of parameters.  The parameter transformations have
          been pushed into C for speed.  It is possible to specify
          native parameter transformation routines in addition to C
          functions, but this last facility has not yet been
          extensively tested.  A new slot ‘has.trans’ has been
          introduced into the ‘pomp’ class, and the types of slots
          ‘par.trans’ and ‘par.untrans’ have changed.

        • ‘parmat’ now gracefully handles the case when ‘params’ is
          already a matrix.

        • Error in the documentation of ‘pfilter’ repaired.  Thanks to
          Alex Smith for pointing this out.

        • Improvements in the documentation of the Nicholson blowflies

        • When a ‘pomp’ object is updated using ‘pomp’, the ‘params’
          slot will now be copied over (appropriately transformed).
          Before, it was simply dropped.

        • The ‘gillespie.sir’ example has been changed to make the
          reporting rate equal to ‘rho’.  Before, it was fixed at 10%.

        • A new error-trap has been put into ‘probe’ and ‘probe.match’
          for the case ‘nsim < nprobes’.  Thanks to Dani Jonas for
          finding this error.

        • More informative error messages when dimension of state space
          or data space disagree internally.

        • The ‘weighted’ argument to ‘mif’ and ‘continue’ is now
          deprecated in favor of a new argument ‘method’.  The old
          ‘weighted=TRUE’ corresponds to ‘method="mif"’ while the old
          ‘weighted=FALSE’ corresponds to ‘method="unweighted"’.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._4_0-_4:

        • New functions ‘traj.match.objfun’ and ‘probe.match.objfun’
          have been added.  These functions construct functions of one
          argument suitable for use as objective functions in
          ‘optim’-like optimizers (iincluding ‘subplex’ and ‘sannbox’).
          Minimizing these functions solves the trajectory-matching
          problem and probe-matching problem, respectively.  This
          allows the user much greater flexibility in choice of
          optimization algorithm than is afforded by ‘traj.match’ and
          ‘probe.match’.

        • The ‘sannbox’ optimizer, which performs simulated annealing
          with box constraints, is now exported and available for
          general use.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._4_0-_3:

        • The ‘bsmc’ method has been improved, due to the contributions
          of Pierre Jacob.  Specifically, ‘bsmc’ no longer reports a
          log-likelihood (which it never actually computed anyway) but
          a log-evidence.  The latter computation was supplied by
          Pierre Jacob.

        • A new helper function, ‘exp2geom_rate_correction’ has been
          added to the ‘pomp.h’ file.  This function computes the rate
          r such that if N \sim geometric(prob=1-\exp(-r dt)) and T
          \sim exponential(rate=R), then E[N dt] = E[T].  This is
          useful in approximating a continuous-time death process by a
          discrete time (Euler) process.  In particular, in such a
          case, ‘T’ is the waiting time to death in the former and
          ‘N*dt’ is the waiting time to death in the latter.  An Euler
          binomial or multinomial process with rate
          ‘r=exp2geom_rate_correction(R,dt)’ will have the same mean
          waiting time as the exponential process with rate ‘R’.
          Thanks to Sebastien Ballesteros for suggesting this.

        • A new helper function, ‘rgammawn’ has been added, with both R
          and C interfaces.  This function draws an increment of a
          Gamma white-noise process with a given intensity.
          Specifically, ‘dw=rgammwn(sigma,dt)’ is Gamma distributed
          with mean ‘dt’ and variance ‘sigma^2*dt’.  In this case,
          ‘mu*dw/dt’ is suitable for use as a random rate in an
          Euler-multinomial process.  Thanks to Sebastien Ballesteros
          for suggesting this.

        • A bug to do with computation of the number of steps needed in
          discrete-time simulation and trajectory computations has been
          fixed.  This bug was introduced in version 0.40-1.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._4_0-_1:

        • It is now possible for discrete-time determistic skeletons to
          have a general step-size.  Before, the stepsize was always
          forced to be 1.  The new argument ‘skelmap.delta.t’ in ‘pomp’
          (default value 1) sets this step-size.  NB: in implementing
          this feature, a new slot has been added to the basic ‘pomp’
          class.  ‘pomp’ objects created with versions <0.40-1 will not
          therefore work with this version and must be re-created.

        • The deterministic skeleton trajectory functions now look for
          variables named in ‘zeronames’ and treat these variables as
          accumulators.  This brings the behavior of the deterministic
          skeleton functions into line with ‘rprocess’.  A new section
          of the “advanced topics” vignette discusses accumulator
          variables and ‘zeronames’.

        • Include the user manual PDF among the vignettes.

        • The new function ‘parmat’ creates a suitable matrix of
          parameters in one line.

          and ‘traj.match’.

        • Fix infelicity in ‘traj.match’ and ‘nlf’ that arises when the
          ‘data’ slot has no rownames.  Rownames are not strictly
          required for the ‘data’ slot.

        • The ‘sannbox’ algorithm now should work even when the
          objective function throws a non-finite value.  The behavior
          now is to replace non-finite values with a large number.
          This behavior follows that of the ‘SANN’ method in ‘optim’.

        • The help files for ‘pfilter’ and ‘mif’ have been updated to
          explain how to use a variable number of particles in the
          particle filtering algorithm.

        • Inside ‘init.state’, a check has been added to make sure that
          the user's initializer function returns a vector of uniform
          size, as per the algorithms' assumptions.  Thanks to Micaela
          Martinez-Bakker for catching this.

        • ‘mif’ has been modified so as to allow estimation of
          initial-value parameters alone via fixed-lag smoothing.

        • When ‘po’ is a ‘pomp’-class object with covariates,
          ‘as.data.frame(po)’ and ‘as(po,"data.frame")’ now contain
          columns for the covariates.  The latter are interpolated, if
          necessary, at the observation times.

        • Bug fix: when ‘pfilter’ is called with a single parameter
          vector supplied in the ‘params’ argument, these parameters
          are copied into the ‘params’ slot of the resulting
          ‘pfilterd.pomp’ object.  Before, this failed when the
          ‘params’ slot of the ‘pomp’ object was empty.  A similar bug
          existed in ‘traj.match’ and has likewise been fixed.

        • To eliminate warnings and confusion during package check,
          ‘profile.design’ has been replaced by ‘profileDesign’.  For
          parallelism, ‘slice.design’ and ‘sobol.design’ have been
          replaced by ‘sliceDesign’ and ‘sobolDesign’, respectively.
          The older forms are now deprecated and will be removed in a
          future release.

        • New facilities for parameter transformation are provided.
          New optional arguments ‘parameter.transform’ and
          ‘parameter.inv.transform’ to ‘pomp’ allow the user to specify
          transformations between natural and internal parameter
          scalings.  A new option ‘transfom’ to ‘coef’ and ‘coef<-’
          allows the user to get and set parameters on the natural
          scale.  See ‘pomp?coef’ and the “intro_to_pomp” vignette for
          details and examples.  Similarly, the ‘conv.rec’ method now
          takes an optional ‘transform’ argument.

        • ‘pfilter’ will now give an error if ever a non-finite
          likelihood (dmeasure value) is returned.  Before, errors were
          only generated when dmeasure returned NA.

        • ‘spect’ now returns frequencies reflective of the observation
          times.  Before, the frequencies were given as fractions of
          the sampling frequency.

        • A new section describing and demonstrating nonlinear
          forecasting has been added to the “intro to pomp” vignette.

        • Fixed bug in ‘nlf’: desire for transient period (nconverge>0)
          was unrecognized.

        • Fixed bug in ‘pomp’ when ‘data’ is of class ‘pomp’: userdata
          should be preserved.

        • Improved discussion of SIR model in “intro to pomp” vignette.

        • In ‘pfilterd.pomp’ objects, ‘saved.states’ and ‘saved.params’
          slots are now length-ntimes lists of arrays.

        • It is now possible to use variable numbers of particles in
          ‘pfilter’.  The ‘Np’ argument may be specified as a single
          number as before, or now as either a vector of numbers or a
          function.

        • The “advanced topics” vignette has been much augmented and
          improved.

        • The ‘euler.sir’ example (load it with ‘data(euler.sir)’) has
          a different measurement model: a discretized normal
          distribution with the same mean and variance as before.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._3_7-_1:

        • The arguments ‘skeleton.map’ and ‘skeleton.vectorfield’ are
          now deprecated.  Specify a discrete-time skeleton using
          ‘skeleton.type="map"’ and a continuous-time skeleton via
          ‘skeleton.type="vectorfield"’.

        • ‘pomp’ is now a generic function.  Calling it on a ‘pomp’
          object copies the object; one can optionally modify some of
          the slots.

        • Two new files ‘gompertz.R’ and ‘gompertz.c’ are in the
          ‘examples’ directory.  These contain codes needed to
          reproduce the Gompertz example in the “intro_to_pomp”
          vignette.

        • The warning messages to do with the default behaviors of
          ‘simulate’ and ‘trajectory’ with respect to the arguments
          ‘times’ and ‘t0’ have been removed.  These warnings were
          introduced in version 0.34-1 to alert users to changes in the
          default behavior of ‘simulate’ and ‘trajectory’ introduced
          with that version.  See the help (‘pomp?simulate’,
          ‘pomp?trajectory’) for details.

        • It is now possible to save both the states and particles
          portions of the filtering distributions computed in
          ‘pfilter’.  This is accomplished by means of the logical
          ‘save.states’ and ‘save.params’ arguments to ‘pfilter’.  The
          particles are stored in rank-3 arrays in the slots
          ‘saved.states’ and ‘saved.params’.  This results in the need
          for a change in the structure of ‘pfilterd.pomp’ objects:
          note that ‘pfilterd.pomp’ objects (including ‘mif’ and
          ‘pmcmc’ objects) created under pre-0.37-1 version of the
          package will not load under versions >= 0.37-1.

        • ‘trajectory’ now gives a more informative error when no
          skeleton is present

        • ‘pred.mean’, ‘pred.var’, and ‘filter.mean’ methods are now
          defined for ‘pfilterd.pomp’ objects (and not just ‘mif’
          objects)

        • A new ‘data()’-loadable example is included: do ‘?blowflies’
          to read about it.

        • The B-spline basis construction functions ‘bspline.basis’ and
          ‘periodic.bspline.basis’ now take a ‘names’ argument that
          allows one to give names to the basis functions.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._3_6-_5:

        • The “intro_to_pomp” vignette has been updated.  The first
          part of the vignette centers on a new, more transparent first
          example.

        • A bug in ‘pfilter’ has been fixed.  This bug was introduced
          in version 0.32-6 (SVN revision 315).  Upon filtering
          failure, state variables were left un-updated.  Thanks to
          Karim Khader for reporting circumstances that led to the
          identification of this bug.

        • There is now a method for ‘loglik’ on ‘probed.pomp’ objects.
          This returns the synthetic likelihood.

        • The box-constrained simulated annealing optimization method
          ‘sannbox’ is now an option in ‘probe.match’.

        • Calling ‘states’ on a ‘pomp’ object having no unobserved
          states now fails gracefully (returning NULL rather than
          generating an error).

        • The rprocess plugin ‘discrete.time.sim’ now takes an optional
          ‘delta.t’ argument to allow for arbitrary (but still
          necessarily regular) spacing of observations.  By default,
          delta.t=1.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._3_6-_1:

        • There are two new classes: ‘traj.matched.pomp’ and
          ‘pfilterd.pomp’ to hold the results of ‘traj.match’ and
          ‘pfilter’ computations, respectively.  The old classes ‘mif’
          and ‘pmcmc’ now inherit from ‘pfilterd.pomp’ in a natural
          way.

        • When ‘traj.match’ is called, the returned ‘traj.matched.pomp’
          object has its ‘states’ slot filled with the model trajectory
          at the fitted parameters.

        • More optimization methods are now provided in ‘traj.match’.
          These include the new algorithm “sannbox”, an optionally
          box-constrained simulated annealing algorithm.

        • ‘probe.match’ is now an S4 method (like ‘pfilter’, ‘mif’,
          ‘pmcmc’, and ‘traj.match’) with methods for classes ‘pomp’,
          ‘probed.pomp’, and ‘probe.matched.pomp’.

        • There is a change to the interface to ‘pfilter’ in that
          ‘save.states’ results in the filling of the ‘last.states’
          slot.  Before version 0.36-1, the ‘pfilter’ returned a list.
          The element ‘states’ of that list corresponds to the slot
          ‘last.states’ in version 0.36-1.  It was necessary to make
          this name-change in order to avoid a conflict with the
          ‘states’ slot inherited from the ‘pomp’ class.

        • Added a facility for computation of ‘synthetic likelihood’
          (Wood 2010) using a robust estimate of the covariance.  A new
          slot in objects of class ‘probed.pomp’ holds this value.

        • The synthetic likelihood is now the quantity that is
          maximized in ‘probe.match’.

        • Added the argument ‘type’ to ‘probe.ccf’ so that either
          cross-covariance or cross-correlation can be returned.
          ‘probe.ccf’ and ‘probe.acf’ now have comparable interfaces.

        • Changed the way that ‘probe.acf’ accepts lags.  Now an
          arbitrary set of lags can be selected.

        • A bug in the new method ‘obs’ has been fixed.

        • A protection-stack overflow bug in ‘probe’ has been fixed.

        • The ‘seed’ slot in ‘probed.pomp’ and ‘spect.pomp’ objects has
          been removed, along with unwanted behavior to do with it.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._3_4-_2:

        • Added a method to coerce ‘probed.pomp’ objects to
          ‘data.frame’ objects.

        • Fix bug when ‘simulate’ is run on objects that inherit from
          ‘pomp’ but are not themselves pomps.  ‘simulate’ should
          return ‘pomp’ objects when ‘obs=FALSE’ and ‘states=FALSE’,
          regardless of what class ‘object’ is.

        • ‘simulate’ and ‘rprocess’ are accelerated somewhat through
          judicious use of ‘memcpy’.

_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _i_n '_p_o_m_p' _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0._3_4-_1:

        • The default behaviors of ‘simulate’ and ‘trajectory’ with
          respect to the argument ‘times’ has changed.  There is a new
          argument, ‘t0’, which specifies the time at which the initial
          conditions obtain.  The default for ‘t0’ is
          ‘timezero(object)’.  The default for ‘times’ is now
          ‘time(object,t0=FALSE)’ (it was ‘time(object,t0=TRUE)’).
          This change eliminates an infelicity in which ‘simulate’ and
          ‘trajectory’ returned undesired values at the initial time.
          Users can ensure that their codes will continue to function
          as intended by specifying the values of the ‘times’ and ‘t0’
          arguments to these functions, thus removing dependence on the
          defaults.  To aid users in modifying their codes, a warning
          is now displayed whenever a potentially affected call is
          made.  These warnings will be removed in a future release.
          See the documentation (‘pomp?simulate’, ‘pomp?trajectory’)
          for a description of the new default behaviors.

        • The ‘states’ slot now holds values of the state process only
          at the times given in the ‘times’ slot.  This is a change
          from the earlier behavior in which the ‘states’ slot
          sometimes included the value of the state process at ‘t0’.

        • ‘simulate’ has been re-implemented in C for speed.

        • A new method ‘obs’ for ‘pomp’ objects returns the contents of
          the ‘data’ slot.  It is synonymous with ‘data.array’.

        • A banner is now displayed on package attachment.

        • ‘coef<-’ now behaves like ordinary vector assignment.

        • ‘probe’ and ‘spect’ now take an argument ‘params’.

        • ‘probe.cov’ and ‘probe.cor’ have been removed in favor of
          ‘probe.acf’ and ‘probe.ccf’.

        • The functions ‘euler.simulate’, ‘onestep.simulate’, and
          ‘onestep.density’, deprecated since version 0.29-1, have been
          removed.

        • Major improvements in speed in the probe-matching routines
          have been realized by coding the computationally-intensive

        • New probes recommended by Simon Wood (Nature 466:1102-1104,
          2010) have been implemented.  In particular, the new function
          ‘probe.marginal’ regresses the marginal distributions of
          actual and simulated data against a reference distribution,
          returning as probes the regression coefficients.
          ‘probe.marginal’ and ‘probe.acf’ have been coded in C for
          speed.

        • This is a major revision.

        • Big improvements to the documentation, including worked
          examples in vignettes and improvements to the manual pages.

        • Encoding models is now much easier through the use of
          “plugin” modules.  These are functions that write the
          ‘rprocess’ and ‘dprocess’ slots given minimal information on
          the structure of the model.

        • A plugin for continuous-time Markov process models using the
          Gillespie algorithm is available.

        • A plugin for discrete-time Markov processes is now available.

        • Several example pomps are now loadable via the ‘data()’
          command.

        • There are changes in the C interface to measurement models
          that are NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  Existing user measurement
          model codes will need to be modified, but these changes are
          minor.

        • The changes are documented in detail in the file
          ‘CHANGES_0.29-1.txt’.

        • The nonlinear forecasting method of Kendall, Ellner, et al.
          is now implemented in the package.  This is an “indirect
          inference” method using quasi-likelihood as an objective
          function.

        • A bug in the Euler simulator was repaired.

        • The Euler simulator no longer calls ‘GetRNGState()’ and
          ‘PutRNGState()’.  When a native routine is used for the Euler
          step, it must contain these calls.

        • A potential bug in the Euler-multinomial simulator was
          repaired.

        • The lookup_table (see file ‘include/pomp.h’) interface for C
          codes has been streamlined.  It is now slightly more
          straightforward to set up a ‘struct lookup_table’.  See the
          examples (‘include/examples’).

        • Added ‘logistic.R’ to the ‘tests’ directory.  This is a
          one-variable stochastic differential equation simulated using
          Euler-Maruyama.

        • The SIR example (‘examples/sir.R’) now includes two pomps:
          one with native routines implementing rprocess, dprocess, and
          skeleton, the other using R files.  The comparison may be
          instructive.

        • Several bugs fixed.

        • This is a major revision.

        • The basic structure of the ‘pomp’ class has been changed to
          better support the use of native routines as well as R
          functions.  In particular, the ‘rmeasure’, ‘dmeasure’, and
          ‘skeleton’ methods can now be specified either as R functions
          or as native routines.  Native routines are specified by
          name; an optional ‘PACKAGE’ argument is provided to narrow
          the search.  The search is done not at the time of the call
          to ‘pomp’ but at the time the function is used.

        • Support has been added for covariates, in the form of lookup
          tables.  This has been accomplished through the addition of
          slots ‘tcovar’, ‘covar’, and ‘covarnames’ to the ‘pomp’
          class.  ‘rmeasure’, ‘dmeasure’, ‘skeleton’, and ‘init.state’
          now perform lookup when covariates exist and pass this
          information to the user-defined function.  ‘rprocess’ and
          ‘dprocess’ receive the full lookup table (‘tcovar’ plus
          ‘covar’).

        • ‘rmeasure’, ‘dmeasure’, and ‘skeleton’ are now specified by a
          function (or native routine) that does the computation for
          ONE state vector and ONE parameter vector.  This is analogous
          to the way that ‘init.state’ has operated from the beginning.
          It greatly simplifies model specification from the user's
          point of view without changing the low-level methods
          interfaces (pomp methods ‘rmeasure’, ‘dmeasure’, ‘skeleton’,
          ‘init.states’).  However, *this change is not
          backward-compatible*: users will need to rewrite code for the
          ‘rmeasure’, ‘dmeasure’, and ‘skeleton’ slots.  In practice,
          this should not be difficult.  It involves removing loops
          over ‘times’ and columns of ‘params’ and (if covariates are
          used in the measurement model or deterministic skeleton)
          making use of the ‘covars’ argument passed to the user
          function.

        • The interface to the ‘euler.simulate’ and ‘euler.density’
          facilities have changed to make them consistent with the new
          pomp class.

        • The header files have been reorganized: ‘include/euler.h’ and
          ‘include/lookup_table.h’ have been replaced with a single
          ‘include/pomp.h’.  Significant additions have been made to
          support the new structure of the pomp class.  Specifically,
          new prototypes have been defined for native routines to
          implement the measurement model, the process model, and the
          deterministic skeleton.
