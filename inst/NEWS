        • We no longer import directly from ‘tidyverse’ functions.
          This reduces the list of packages upon which ‘pomp’ depends
          from 20 to 5.  This does introduce a dependency on the
          ‘data.table’ package.

        • The ‘dimnames’ attributes of various arrays that appear in
          ‘pomp’, including arrays of observables, state variables,
          parameters, covariates, and so on, have been made uniform.
          In particular, when a dimension of an array corresponds to
          variables with different names, this dimension is itself
          named “name”.  Previously, its name was sometimes “variable”
          and sometimes “parameter”.  This change is meant to
          streamline interaction with the ‘tidyverse’.

        • The ‘states’ and ‘obs’ methods take a new optional argument,

        • When ‘melt’ is applied to a list, the identifier variable is

          ‘as.data.frame’ is used to coerce a list of ‘pomp’ objects,
          and when ‘saved_states’ is used to extract the particles from
          a list of ‘pfilterd_pomp’ objects.

        • ‘logmeanexp’ can now compute the effective sample size, which
          can be useful in determining the reliability of its estimate.
          To do so, set ‘ess=TRUE’ in a call to ‘logmeanexp’.

          ‘saved_states’.  This allows the user to extract the relevant
          elements in data-frame format if desired.

        • ‘pomp’ no longer depends on the superseded package
          ‘reshape2’.  The ‘melt’ function for converting arrays and
          nested lists into data frames is accordingly no longer
          re-exported from ‘reshape2’.  It has been replaced by a
          stricter version of ‘melt’.

        • The ‘magrittr’ pipe ‘%>%’ is no longer re-exported by ‘pomp’:
          use the native R pipe ‘|>’ instead.

        • The package now requires R version 4.1 at least.

        • All ‘pomp’ functions with names.that.contain.dots have been
          deprecated in favor of functions in ‘snake_case’.  This is to
          avoid anticipated problems with CRAN checks, which (falsely)
          assume that certain functions with dotted.names are S3
          methods.  From this point, no exported ‘pomp’ function has
          such a name.

        • The ‘dimnames’ attributes for some of the arrays computed in
          ‘pfilter’ and ‘pmcmc’ computations have changed.  In
          particular, whereas in previous versions, the ‘time’
          dimension was given names that were character strings
          composed of decimal representations of the time (difficult to
          work with and prone to roundoff error), the ‘time’ dimension
          now is not given names.

        • A bug that resulted in ‘gompertz’ giving different

        • The weighted quantile function ‘wquant’ now uses the

        • It is now possible to retrieve the weighted particles

          ‘pfilter’ and retrieve the particles and their weights using

        • The precise order in which the ‘pmcmc’ function computes
          prior and likelihood of furnished and proposed parameters has
          changed slightly.  This prevents proposals that are
          incompatible with the prior from being passed to ‘pfilter’
          and forestalls an associated class of errors.  A consequence
          of this change, ‘pmcmc’ computations using the new version
          will differ very slightly from previous computations, even
          with the RNG seed fixed at its previous values.

     Version 4 contains a few changes that are not backward compatible.
     These are all to do with the elementary function ‘trajectory’,
     which computes trajectories of the deterministic dynamical
     skeleton.  See below for details.

        • The behavior of ‘trajectory’ now fully conforms to the
          behavior of other ‘pomp’ elementary functions.  In
          particular, one can now add, remove, or modify basic model
          components in a call to ‘trajectory’ just as one can with
          ‘simulate’, ‘pfilter’, ‘probe’, etc.  Before version 4,
          additional arguments to ‘trajectory’ (i.e., those passed via
          ‘...’) were passed on to the ODE integrator in the case of
          continuous-time deterministic skeletons (i.e., vectorfields)
          and ignored in the case of discrete-time skeletons (i.e.,
          maps).  As of version 4, in order to adjust ODE integrator
          settings it is necessary to use the ‘ode_control’ argument of
          ‘trajectory’.  This behavior matches that of ‘traj_objfun’.

        • It is now possible to create a ‘pomp’ object from scratch
          using ‘trajectory’, together with a specification of the
          rinit and skeleton components.  Prior to version 4, in order
          to do so, it was necessary to first create a dummy data set,
          then call ‘pomp’, and then pass the resulting ‘pomp’ object
          to ‘trajectory’.  This can now be achieved in one call.

        • The user now has the option, in a call to ‘trajectory’, to
          have the results returned as one or ‘pomp’ objects.  In this
          regard, its behavior matches that of ‘simulate’.

        • The workhorse function ‘flow’ now has default arguments.

        • The stateful objective function created by ‘traj_objfun’ has

          a zero-length numeric vector.  Calling such a function with
          no arguments is valid if and only if the objective function
          was created with no variables to estimate (empty ‘est’).

          matches the current version.  Thus, changes to the code
          automatically trigger recomputation.

        • ‘bake’ and ‘stew’ take the new argument ‘dependson’.  Using
          this argument, the user can specify objects upon which the
          computation depends.  These should be passed as unquoted
          variables; if there are multiple dependencies, they can be
          passed using ‘c’ or ‘list’.  Digests of these objects will be
          archived and checked against current values on subsequent
          calls.  Thus, changing any dependency will automatically
          trigger recomputation.

        • ‘bake’ now archives the information pertinent to the ‘bake’
          call; this information is no longer returned along with the
          result of the computation (unless ‘info=TRUE’).  Similarly,
          ‘stew’ stores a list, “.ingredients”, in the file it creates.
          In the ‘stew’ case, unlike all the other objects that are
          created by ‘expr’, this list is _not_ by default loaded into
          the calling environment (e.g., the user's workspace).  It
          will be loaded if the ‘info’ flag is set to ‘TRUE’.

        • ‘freeze’ no longer stores the details of the RNG seed and
          kind as an attribute of the returned object.

        • A note to Windows users on avoiding certain C snippet
          compilation errors has been added to the help pages.

        • The behavior of ‘profile_design’ has changed.  Previously,
          the same random (or sub-random) sequence was used for all
          non-profile parameters.  Now, for each profile slice, a
          distinct set of points is generated.

        • ‘profileDesign’, ‘sliceDesign’, ‘runifDesign’, and
          ‘sobolDesign’ have been deprecated and will be removed in a
          future release.  They are replaced by ‘profile_design’,

        • In ‘mif2’, the specification of particle numbers, ‘Np’, has
          changed.  When ‘Np’ is supplied as a function, ‘Np(0)’ is the
          requested number of particles at the beginning of the time
          series.  The previous behavior was that ‘Np(1)’ specified the
          requested number of particles.  This behavior now matches
          that of the other particle filtering algorithms, ‘pfilter’,
          ‘bsmc2’, and ‘pmcmc’.

        • ‘bsmc2’ can now accept a variable number of particles, as do
          the other particle-filter based algorithms ‘pfilter’,
          ‘pmcmc’, and ‘mif2’.

        • The internal ‘systematic_resample’ function now allows the
          user to specify the number of samples desired.  Previously,
          these were always equal to the number of weights supplied.

        • As promised from version 2.4.1, the ‘tol’ and ‘max.fail’
          arguments have been removed completely from all
          particle-filtering algorithms, including ‘pfilter’, ‘pmcmc’,
          ‘bsmc2’, and ‘mif2’.  See the ‘pomp’ news blog
          (<https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/blog.html>) for more

        • It is now permissible that the sequence of observation times

        • In the course of ordinary work, one should never need to
          interact with the low-level ‘pomp’ constructor function now.

        • The ‘pompExample’ function has been dropped.  The various
          examples are now included as regular functions that construct
          ‘pomp’ objects.

        • The ‘bbs’ example has been dropped.

        • One can now modify basic model components at (almost) any
          stage in a pipeline of ‘pomp’ computations.  All the
          top-level inference functions, plus ‘probe’, ‘pfilter’, and
          ‘simulate’ now allow modification of basic model components.

        • The ‘rprocess’ plugins ‘onestep.sim’, ‘discrete.time.sim’,
          ‘euler.sim’, ‘gillespie.sim’, and ‘gillespie.hl.sim’ have
          been renamed ‘onestep’, ‘discrete_time’, ‘euler’,
          ‘gillespie’, and ‘gillespie_hl’, respectively.  The old usage
          is available but deprecated.

        • One can now call ‘simulate’ on a model without reference to
          any data.

        • The covariate table facility (‘covariate_table’) now supports
          piecewise constant interpolation.

        • The syntax with which one includes covariates via
          ‘covariate_table’ has become more flexible.  Specifically,
          the arguments to ‘covariate_table’ are now evaluated
          sequentially, so that later ones can depend on earlier ones.
          Once evaluated, the covariates are bound column-wise into a
          single data frame.

        • The manner in which one writes R functions to specify basic
          model components has been totally changed.  Before, one wrote
          functions that took specific arguments such as 'x', 'params',
          and 'covars'.  Now, one writes such functions with any or all
          state variables, observables, covariates, and/or time as
          arguments.

        • ‘simulate’ now returns more informative results when
          simulations from multiple parameter sets are simultaneously
          computed.  Specifically, if ‘params’ has column names, these
          are used to identify the resulting simulations.  Thus when
          ‘format = "pomps"’ (the default), the names of the resulting
          list will be constructed from the column names of ‘params’.
          Likewise, when ‘format = "arrays"’, the resulting arrays will
          have informative column names; When ‘format = "data.frame"’,
          the identifier variable will make use of the column names.

        • The basic particle filter, ‘pfilter’, has a simpler mode of
          operation: ‘params’ should be a single parameter set only.
          That is, it is no longer possible to pass a matrix of
          parameters to ‘pfilter’.

        • The Liu-West algorithm, ‘bsmc2’, has a simpler mode of
          operation: ‘params’ should be a single parameter set only:
          the SMC particles are drawn from ‘rprior’.

        • The ‘as.data.frame’, ‘states’, and ‘obs’ options for
          ‘simulate’ have been done away with.  One now chooses the
          format of the returned simulations via the ‘format’ argument.
          When one simulates at multiple parameter sets, list names,
          array ‘dimnames’, or identifying variables in the output data
          frame help to correlate simulations with parameter sets.

        • The ‘as.data.frame’ argument to ‘trajectory’ has been removed
          in favor of a new ‘format’ argument that allows one to choose
          between receiving the results in the form of an ‘"array"’ or
          a ‘"data.frame"’.

        • All the basic model components now have defaults.

            • The default ‘rinit’ behavior remains as it was: it
              assumes the initial state distribution is concentrated at
              a point mass determined by parameters with “‘.0’” or
              “‘_0’” suffices.

            • The default process model is “missing”: calls to
              ‘dprocess’ and ‘rprocess’ will result in missing values
              (‘NA’).

            • The default measurement model is “missing” as well.

            • The default prior is flat and improper: all calls to the
              default ‘dprior’ result in ‘1’ (‘0’ if ‘log = TRUE’, and
              all calls to ‘rprior’ result in ‘NA’.

            • The default skeleton is missing.

            • The default parameter transformations remain the
              identity.

        • The ‘transform’ argument present in many ‘pomp’ algorithms
          has been removed.  Parameter transformations are now
          automatically performed when appropriate.  The default
          parameter transformation remains the identity.

        • The old ‘probe.match’ and ‘traj.match’ functions have been
          removed.  The new approach to parameter estimation based on
          numerical optimization involves constructing stateful
          objective functions.  There are now three of these:
          ‘traj.match.objfun’, ‘probe.match.objfun’, and
          ‘spect.match.objfun’.

        • The documentation system has been thoroughly overhauled.

        • In ‘skeleton’, the ‘t’ argument has been replaced by ‘times’,
          to make this uniform with the other workhorse functions.

        • Covariates are now included using the ‘covariate_table’
          construction, passed via the ‘covar’ argument to ‘pomp’.  The
          ‘tcovar’ argument is no longer used.

        • Instead of providing separate ‘fromEstimationScale’ and
          ‘toEstimationScale’ arguments to ‘pomp’, one now provides a
          single ‘partrans’ argument constructed by means of the new
          function ‘parameter_trans’.  In addition, references to
          “fromEstimationScale” and “toEstimationScale” have been
          abbreviated to “fromEst” and “toEst”, respectively,
          throughout the package.

        • When writing C snippets for parameter transformations, the
          notation ‘T_p’ refers to the value of ‘p’ on the estimation
          scale.  Thus, if parameter alpha is to be log-transformed for
          estimation, the ‘toEst’ snippet would contain the line
          ‘T_alpha = log(alpha);’ and the ‘fromEst’ snippet would
          include ‘alpha = exp(T_alpha);’.

        • The ‘parameter_trans’ function now takes optional arguments
          ‘log’, ‘logit’, and ‘barycentric’, with names of parameters
          to be log-, logit-, and log-barycentric transformed,
          respectively.

        • The ‘measurement.model’ argument to ‘pomp’ has been removed.
          It is now necessary to specify the measurement model directly
          using ‘rmeasure’ and/or ‘dmeasure’.

        • The ‘initializer’ is no longer referred to by that name.  It
          is now ‘rinit’, since it draws from the distribution of the
          latent state at the initial time.  The low-level function
          ‘init.state’ has been replaced by ‘rinit’.

        • The ‘conv.rec’ method has been deprecated, replaced by the
          new ‘traces’ method.

        • The ‘euler.sir’ example has been renamed ‘sir’.

        • The ‘gillespie.sir’ example has been renamed ‘sir2’.

        • The ‘covmat’ method can now be applied to a ‘probed.pomp’
          object.  It returns the estimated covariance matrix of the
          probes.

        • When ‘trajectory’ calls on ‘deSolve’ routines to numerically
          integrate a model vectorfield, more informative error
          messages are generated, and diagnostics are printed when
          ‘verbose = TRUE’.

        • The ‘show’ method applied to pomp objects is now quite terse.
          To obtain detailed information, the ‘spy’ method is
          available.

        • The ‘spy’ method now returns the information formerly
          displayed in a call to ‘show’, in addition to the C files
          associated with any C snippets.

        • The use of ‘$’ methods to access the slots of ‘pomp’ S4
          objects has now been removed.  These classes are no longer
          exported (for the most part).

        • The ‘transform’ argument to the ‘probe.quantile’ function has
          been removed (as it is entirely redundant!).

        • The old and deprecated ‘mif’ and ‘bsmc’ methods have been
          removed.

        • The ‘obs’ and ‘states’ arguments of ‘simulate’ are deprecated
          and will be removed in a forthcoming release.

        • The C-level interface for ‘apply_probe_sims’ has changed: the
          new argument ‘rho’ must be the “package:pomp” environment.

        • A bug in ‘pfilter’ (and hence ‘pmcmc’) when
          ‘filter.traj=TRUE’ was discovered and fixed.  In the buggy
          version, the filter trajectory was sampled with incorrect
          weights.

        • Timo Voipio contributed a pull request that traps the error
          resulting from ‘sannbox’ being passed a ‘candidate.dist’ that

        • ‘show’ and ‘print’ methods have been made very terse: they
          simply report on the class of the object in question.  To see
          more detailed information about a ‘pomp’ object, use ‘spy’.

        • New (unexported) ‘solibs<-’ method allows developers of
          packages extending ‘pomp’ to incorporate C snippets into
          object that contain ‘pomp’ objects.

        • New ‘verbose’ option in ‘trajectory’ gives diagnostic
          information from ‘deSolve’ integration routines.  Of course,
          this is pertinent only if the model skeleton is a
          vectorfield.

        • Bug in the display of ‘istate’ when ‘deSolve::ode’ errors has
          been fixed.

        • New ‘hitch’ function facilitates construction of ‘pomp.fun’
          objects from R functions, C snippets, and links to external
          libraries.

        • Native routines needed to access ‘pomp.fun’ objects in C are
          now registered for use by other packages.

        • ‘coef(object) <- NULL’, where ‘object’ is of class ‘pomp’,
          erases any parameters stored in ‘object’.

        • The ‘euler.sir’, ‘gillespie.sir’, ‘blowflies’, ‘ricker’,
          ‘bbs’, ‘dacca’, and ‘rw2’ examples are all now implemented
          using C snippets.

        • A new ‘pomp_defines.h’ header is provided for developers of
          packages that depend on ‘pomp’.

        • Internally, ‘rprocess’ is no longer stored as an R function.
          The use of plugins is now required for the implementation of
          the ‘rprocess’ component.  Currently, there are five plugins
          available: ‘onestep.sim’, ‘discrete.time.sim’, ‘euler.sim’,
          ‘gillespie.sim’, and ‘gillespie.hl.sim’.

        • The new ‘hitch’ function automates the building and linking
          of C snippets and R functions into ‘pomp.fun’s.

        • The handling of ‘dprocess’ has changed.  The ‘onestep.dens’
          plugin is now deprecated and will soon be removed.
          ‘dprocess’ is now specified directly using either a C snippet
          or an R function, in much the same way that, for example,
          ‘dmeasure’ is specified.

        • The old ‘forward’ and ‘inverse’ options for the ‘dir’
          argument of ‘partrans’ have been dispensed with.  The much
          more descriptive options ‘toEstimationScale’ and
          ‘fromEstimationScale’ remain.

        • ‘mif2’, ‘pfilter’, ‘probe’, ‘probe.match’, and
          ‘probe.match.objfun’ can now gracefully handle a list in the

        • The deprecated options to supply a matrix or numeric vector

          ‘data’, must now be provided either as a data frame or as an
          object of class ‘pomp’.  See ‘?pomp’ for details.

        • The deprecated ‘skeleton.type’ and ‘skelmap.delta.t’
          arguments to ‘pomp’ have been removed.  Using these arguments

        • During particle filtering, when non-finite ‘dmeasure’ values

          reported parameters were on the transformed (estimation)
          scale, which can be confusing.  The error message now gives
          the parameters on the natural (model) scale.

        • A bug in ‘mif2’ arising when filtering fails in the final
          timestep has been fixed.  In this case, when all particles

          step-sizes are chosen in the ‘euler.sim’,
          ‘discrete.time.sim’, and ‘onestep.sim’ plugins has been
          spelled out explicitly.  Also, incompleteness in the
          ‘sannbox’ documentation has been corrected.
